    "markdown":"The sun and earth are separated by millions of miles of vacuum. Yet, life on earth depends on the ability of the sun to transfer energy through this vacuum and heat the earth to habitable temperatures. This heat transfer is possible because electromagnetic waves from the sun travel through vacuum and deposit energy onto the earth, a process called radiation. In contrast, our everyday experience with heat transfer between solids relies on the mechanism of heat conduction. Heat conduction arises from the transfer of vibrations. Any solid object at a non-zero temperature is constantly, spontaneously vibrating at the atomic scale. The typical amplitude of these vibrations is set by the temperature. When a hotter object comes into contact with a colder one, vibrational energy from the hotter region is transferred to the colder object, causing it to warm up.   \n  \nSince the advent of modern thermodynamics, it was believed that radiation was the only way that heat could be transmitted through vacuum, since conduction was thought to require a physical medium to support vibrational waves. Now, a new experiment from Berkeley Professor Xiang Zhang's lab in the Department of Mechanical Engineering has shown that, at least over short distances, heat conduction through a vacuum is possible.   \n  \nThis stunning result, which upturns hundreds of years of conventional wisdom, relies on the fact that the vacuum is not quite as empty as it appears. Quantum mechanics demonstrates that a vacuum is empty only on average. There are quantum fluctuations where photons, the particles associated with the electromagnetic field, pop in and out of existence. As a result of these fluctuations, the vacuum contains intrinsic energy known as the zero-point energy. Ordinarily, the zero-point energy is not observable, but by straddling a region of vacuum with metal plates, it turns out that the zero-point energy between them is modified relative to the space outside. This difference in energy, known as the Casimir effect, has dramatic physical consequences.   \n  \nTheorists had recently recognized that the Casimir effect could mediate the transfer of heat from a hot object to a cold object through the vacuum via bona fide conduction. The thermal energy contained in the vibrations of the hot object could be transferred through the vacuum directly into thermal vibrations of the colder object. However, physicists had yet to observe the phenomenon.   \n  \nIn order to observe the Casimir effect, the Zhang Lab had to overcome many experimental challenges. Two small ceramic plates 0.3 centimeters in length, one heated about 20\u00b0C hotter than the other, were placed in an artificial vacuum. Since the strength of the heat conduction in vacuum is proportional to how close the two plates are together, every effort had to be made to make the distance between the plates as small as possible, and to keep it constant while the temperature of the plates was being measured. Dr. Hao-Kun Li, a lead author on the study and a former graduate student in Zhang\u2019s lab, describes the effort: \u201cWe had to build, from scratch, a setup to bring two mechanical membranes as close together as 300 nanometers [apart] using both electrical and optical interference methods.\u201d (That\u2019s nearly 1000 times smaller than the width of a human hair.)   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/heat-conduction\\_1-1.png) *When a hot micromechanical plate is brought near a colder one in vacuum (left), fluctuating quantum fields give rise to a spring-like mechanical coupling between them (center). This coupling allows thermal energy to conduct until the two reach the same temperature (right). Image Design: Gautam Gunjala*   \n  \nTo achieve precise positional control, the Zhang Lab used an innovative technique: reflecting lasers off of each plate and measuring the resulting interference to precisely adjust their orientations. These lasers were also used as indirect thermometers to provide a precise measurement of the vibrations of the plates. This latter capability was key to allowing the researchers to observe the heat transfer with a relatively large separation.   \n  \nWith their novel experimental apparatus, the Zhang Lab was able to accomplish what other groups had failed to do and measure a temperature change in the plates that was undeniably due to heat conduction through the vacuum. The demonstration of this effect opens up numerous avenues of future research in thermodynamics. In particular, the dissipation of heat \u201cis a key factor that limits the size and speed of electronics,\u201d Dr. Li says. \u201cWhat we found is that instead of engineering materials, one can engineer the vacuum.\u201d With further improvements in the way the vibrations in materials are able to couple to each other, vacuum conduction may become an important tool in the design of nanoelectronics. At the very least, the discovery of an entirely new mechanism of heat transfer shows us that the quantum world still holds mysteries waiting to be uncovered.",

I watch as USGS Geologist Dave Schoellhamer rubs mud between his fingers. \"This has been my whole career,\" he says of the wet slurry. I\u2019m here to learn from the experts who observe and measure the mud at the bottom of the San Francisco Bay. Schoellhamer\u2019s multi-decade career was built on this research, but I\u2019ve spent only a few days on the topic.   \n  \nOur team\u2014a collection of US Geological Survey (USGS) scientists and skippers from Santa Cruz and Sacramento\u2014is here to study how sediments in the Bay and the processes that affect sediments change across the seasons. Sediment is a foundational component of the Bay\u2019s ecology: a habitat for small organisms, a source of cloudy water for certain fish, and, ultimately, a building block for the marshes that support shoreline birds and plants. Unfortunately, sediment can also carry contaminants, so understanding how, when, and where the sediment moves helps scientists follow heavy metals and persistent pollutants.   \n  \nJessica Lacy, USGS oceanographer and the project lead, brought me in to help with the project, starting with what they call deployment: attaching oceanographic sensors to tripods that will sit on the bed of the Bay. These sensors will measure water currents, wave motions, sediment size, and turbidity\u2014the muddiness of the water. After the study period is over, we\u2019ll pull the sensors to the surface and analyze patterns in the data to understand the conditions under which mud gets swept off the bed and pushed around the Bay. Sensor preparation requires a lot of eyes to triple-check their programming, specs, and positions, pulling our team members out of their offices to share moments of close attention. Lacy corrals the action on the busy sensor-prep days, and the result is months of good data that captures slow-moving sedimentation processes.   \n  \nMy biggest role in the field is to orchestrate sediment sampling, which happens every week or two while the sensors sit in the water. This sampling is why I am sharing a boat with Lacy and Schoellhamer today: we send a giant scoop over the side of the boat and pull up cores of mud. We slice the cores and tuck the slices into bags, so we can bring them back to the lab and analyze them for density and grain size. By collecting these data regularly throughout the deployment, we\u2019ll be able to see how the sediment makeup is changing with depth and time. Comparing our samples to the hydrodynamic measurements from the sensors allows us to understand the mechanisms that drive the change. Is the mud compacting, or getting fluffed-up by waves? Are the sediment transport mechanisms intense enough to move coarse grains or only very fine muds? In essence, we are asking if the Bay floor is eroding or accreting and why.   \n  \nTo answer these questions in more detail, we'll turn to simulations that can be validated with the field measurements we're taking now. My background is in mathematics, so fieldwork, with all of its complications, is new to me. I find it eye-opening to learn that this day on the water and the messiness of our sampling will become the standardized data to populate the surface roughness, erodibility, and sediment properties in our models. Our simulations will evolve and improve over time due to long-term monitoring work upheld by a community of committed researchers from the USGS, San Francisco Estuary Institute, San Francisco State, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, Stanford, California state agencies, and more. This network and lineage of researchers allows our data to contribute to understanding how the Bay and its muds have changed over history.   \n  \nThe sediment in the San Francisco Bay has been altered by many human influences, beginning with the rapid influx of people during the California Gold Rush. A 1917 USGS publication by geologist G.K. Gilbert showed how hydraulic mining\u2014a destructive technique used during the Gold Rush\u2014created an enormous pulse of sediment that flowed downstream from the Sierras and slowly entered the San Francisco Bay. Recent USGS research suggests that the hydraulic mining debris stuck around in Central Valley river floodplains and bayside marshes, which served as slowly eroding reservoirs of sediment\u2014until those reservoirs ran out of sediment in the late 1990s. In the intervening time, Californian waterways were dammed, diverted, and managed, throttling delivery of sediment to the Bay. In essence, we exhausted the sediment reserve that was keeping the Bay healthy and are no longer receiving much from upstream. At the same time, the little sediments that the Bay receives has been loaded with contaminants: high levels of mercury from local mercury mines like New Almaden, polychlorinated biphenyl waste from legacy industrial activities, and radioactive mud left behind from the Bay Area\u2019s history of nuclear production and decommissioning. The fate of the Bay\u2019s sediments determines its continued habitability for millions of creatures, including us. We cannot undo our legacy of impact on the system, but we can change it for the better going forward. It starts with looking closely at what sediment we have.   \n  \nA sense of urgency has brought our team together to track the changes in this crucial, overlooked resource. At the moment, though, the tone is relaxed. We\u2019re quietly floating in the middle of the Bay, miles from shore. As the fog lifts and the breeze picks up, I feel happy that I\u2019m sinking my hands into Bay mud with other people who care, happy that we can find insight into what shapes this landscape, happy that our sensors are down there, quietly monitoring. These days will become points in our data set, but the memories of time out on the water will keep me caring and coming back to the Bay and its mud.   \n  \n*Lukas WinklerPrins is a graduate student in environmental engineering.*   \n  \nDesign: Mohini Bariya   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/FromTheField2.png) *A tripod mounted with oceanographic sensors collects measurements on the Bay floor.

    "markdown":"Just off the edge of the North American continental shelf, only tens of miles away from the hubbub of the Bay Area, it is quiet, cold, and dark. Half a kilometer of seawater presses down at about fifty times atmospheric pressure. This is a remote and inhospitable place, enough so that even with today\u2019s technology, learning about the seafloor is a daunting endeavor. Seafloor measurements are generally done using temporary sensors that are challenging to build and costly to retrieve. However, research published from UC Berkeley last December suggests an easier way to monitor the ocean floor by using existing seafloor fiber optic cables. This technique could reveal marine fault lines and even detect submarine earthquakes before they hit shore.   \n  \nSensors used for seafloor monitoring must withstand constant saltwater exposure and intense pressure. Without access to electrical outlets or even sunlight, they must be able to power themselves for an extended period of time. Craig Dawe, technical support manager of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, explains that the biggest hurdle to using remote sensors is how to recover them once the battery runs down. \u201cYou can just throw stuff over the side,\u201d he sums up, \u201cbut to get it back up is a little more of a challenge.\u201d Researchers generally retrieve seafloor sensors using complicated and expensive remotely operated marine vehicles.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/DeepWebBrief\\_2-e1587430229856.png) *\"Dr. Nate Lindsey, recent graduate of Berkeley\u2019s Earth and Planetary Sciences program, has found a more efficient way to monitor the ocean floor by repurposing seafloor technology that\u2019s already there: fiber optic cables.\" Image Design: Alison H. Nguyen*   \n  \nDr. Nate Lindsey, recent graduate of Berkeley\u2019s Earth and Planetary Sciences program, has found a more efficient way to monitor the ocean floor by repurposing seafloor technology that\u2019s already there: fiber optic cables. These bundles of hair-thin glass wires can transmit light over vast distances. They span the world\u2019s oceans and provide the physical underpinning of the global internet. Using a technology called distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), the cable itself becomes a seafloor motion sensor.   \n  \nThe shoreside end of the cable is connected to a laser, which shines a pulse of light down the cable\u2019s length. At regular intervals, distortions in the fiber reflect light back to a detector on shore. Tiny motions of the seafloor put strain on the cable, which affects the precise timing of the returning reflections. The farther the light travels before it\u2019s reflected, the longer it takes to return, so a single pulse of light causes a \u201ctrain\u201d of reflections, each of which can be matched back to a particular point. By measuring the timing of the returning light, researchers can figure out how the cable is moving, and thus can measure the motion of the seafloor as if they had thousands of individual motion sensors.   \n  \nDAS was first used in 2009 to monitor ground movements caused by oil drilling, but until recently, it had only been used on land. Lindsey did the first marine DAS recordings in 2018 in Monterey Bay, after realizing that the technology was ideally suited to measuring earth movements in remote or hostile environments. This is because the most fragile part of the DAS system, the laser itself, could be set up on one end of the sturdy fiber optic cable, kilometers away from the parts of the cable that are collecting data. Lindsey was able to do all the work from shore by connecting the laser to the shoreside end of a seafloor cable.   \n  \nAs Lindsey had hoped for, the DAS system was sensitive enough to detect the tiny earth movements caused by ocean waves. What he wasn\u2019t expecting was a magnitude 3.2 earthquake to hit only 25 kilometers away. \u201cThe odds of occurrence during the four-day experiment were really low,\u201d says Lindsey, \u201cbut we were fortunate, and observed the earthquake\u2019s waves going through the fault zone as they passed by.\u201d In fact, the patterns of seismic waves radiating from the earthquake allowed him to map several undiscovered fault lines directly under the cable. Such submarine fault lines can be the sources of earthquakes and tsunamis, but their remote location makes them easily overlooked.   \n  \nDAS can efficiently collect a vast amount of information about seafloor motions, helping researchers map fault lines and potentially providing an early-warning system for marine earthquakes. Over a million kilometers of fiber optic cable line the seafloor. If even a tiny fraction of that could be hooked up to DAS lasers, we could get to the bottom of many unanswered questions about seafloor geology and ocean dynamics\u2014all without getting our feet wet.",

Nayak started her graduate career as an environmental engineer where she studied bioremediation\u2014the process by which plants and microbes detoxify chemicals in the environment. Over time, she became less interested in how chemicals are detoxified and more fascinated by why bioremediation occurs in the first place. Nayak reminisces, \u201cIt was small things, often microscopic,\u201d that led to her current research focus on a group of microscopic organisms called archaea. Archaea play a large role in climate change. The subset of archaea studied in the Nayak lab are producers of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas. These microorganisms not only live within us, impacting everything from our immune system to our behavior, but also within plants and other animals. According to Nayak, nearly 80 percent of the methane in the environment comes from archaea residing within and around us, yet very little is known about these microorganisms. Nayak is currently the only faculty member in MCB studying archaea. Using an integrative approach including CRISPR genome-editing technology, the Nayak lab is researching the biology of methanogenic archaea. They have uncovered the surprisingly social lifestyle of these microorganisms and the role archaea play in animal origins. Additionally, the Nayak lab is working to tap into the biotechnological potential of these methane-producing microorganisms. Regarding the transition to her new role as an assistant professor, Nayak enthuses, \u201cAt the end of the day, the science is what keeps you going.\u201d   \n  \n\u2014SHANNON O'BRIEN",

    "markdown":"How do you prove something in the past happened? This is the question driving evolutionary biologists like Dr. Marianna Karageorgi, a postdoc working with Professor Noah Whiteman in the Department of Integrative Biology. Karageorgi is fascinated with uncovering the mechanisms of evolution. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to do comparative studies, and say \u2018This species is different from this species\u2019 to infer how traits might have evolved,\u201d she notes. \u201cIt\u2019s another to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to prove this is how it happened.\u2019\u201d One of the holy grails of modern evolutionary biology is figuring out how to test hypotheses about evolution in living organisms. In a recent study, Karageorgi and her collaborators did just that. They engineered specific mutations from the monarch butterfly into the fruit fly, bestowing it the monarch\u2019s resistance to milkweed toxin. In doing so, they bridged two worlds of technologies: statistical methods for developing evolutionary hypotheses, and genome-editing tools for verifying those hypotheses.   \n  \nStatistics, enabled by lots of data, is the workhorse for evolutionary biologists developing conjectures about an unobservable past. Most evolutionary hypotheses are formulated by sequencing the genes of different species, then using statistical methods to uncover hidden patterns that differ between their DNA. Such patterns can suggest relationships between species, or whether a mutation is associated with a trait of interest, like toxin resistance.   \n  \nKarageorgi\u2019s team used two statistical methods, phylogenetic inference and ancestral state reconstruction (ASR), to conjecture the gene sequences of the common ancestors of toxin-resistant insects. Species are related to each other through mutations, so the number of mutations between a pair of species indicates how long ago their common ancestor existed. Phylogenetic inference combines this information from every pair of species to reconstruct the tree of relationships between species and their common ancestors, called a phylogeny. At each fork in the tree, which represents a common ancestor, ASR computes the most probable gene sequence, based on inferred rates of mutation and the descendants\u2019 mutations. Together, phylogenetic inference and ASR paint a picture of the evolutionary history of a gene.   \n  \nHowever, it\u2019s not always clear which mutations in that history were important. \u201cMost mutations that persist are neutral, meaning they may not affect the function of the gene,\u201d explains Julianne Pelaez, a PhD candidate working with Whiteman. Positions of a gene critical to its function tend to evolve slower, so the team analyzed the rates of evolution inferred from ASR at each position to hypothesize which specific mutations were needed for toxin resistance. They identified two mutations in toxin-resistant insects, occurring at positions 111 and 122 of a particular gene.   \n  \nFurther analysis also flagged a mutation at position 119, which had initially been bypassed because it existed in both toxin-resistant and non-resistant insects. To pinpoint it, Pelaez looked for mutations that co-evolved, or often appeared together, and found that the mutation at 119 always occurred before the one at 122. \u201cIf [the mutation] is always present, most likely it has a pre-adaptive role: it\u2019s preventing something bad from happening,\u201d explains Karageorgi. The team estimated how likely this mutational order occurred by chance, using a statistical technique called a permutation test. This probability was low, meaning it was unlikely that 122 always mutated after 119 purely by coincidence. That meant 119 played a critical\u2014if mysterious\u2014role in the evolution of toxin resistance.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/MonarchBrief\\_1.png) *\"A hypothesis emerged: mutations at 111 and 122 provided resistance, while a mutation at 119 somehow set the stage for 122, perhaps by counteracting side effects.\" Image Design: Alison H. Nguyen*   \n  \nA hypothesis emerged: mutations at 111 and 122 provided resistance, while a mutation at 119 somehow set the stage for 122, perhaps by counteracting side effects. To test their hypothesis, the team turned to CRISPR, a genome-editing technology for introducing precise mutations into organisms. The plan was to introduce the mutations into fruit flies, which are not resistant to milkweed toxin, and see if they too became resistant.   \n  \nLo and behold, the \u201cmonarch flies\u201d acquired the same degree of toxin resistance as the monarch butterfly. Perhaps more interestingly, flies that had the mutation at 122 without the one at 119 had severe neuronal defects, demonstrating the necessity of 119 and of mutational order in evolutionary history.   \n  \nKarageorgi notes that copious data allowed them to generate their hypothesis. \u201cASR was possible because the sequences of all these insects were available \u2026 [Without] such an extensive dataset, we wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d Similarly, for phylogenetic inference, \u201cmore sequence data can generate more robust results,\u201d says Pelaez. \u201cAnd all the rest of the analyses are dependent on this.\u201d",

    "markdown":"In 1960, mathematician Norbert Wiener wrote an article in Science titled \u201cSome Moral and Technical Consequences of Automation.\u201d This article was the seminal work that began asking ethical and philosophical questions about the field of scientific inquiry known as artificial intelligence (AI); the quest to build machines that can think and reason about the world. Wiener outlined the concerns and challenges that engineers and researchers would face as machines began to exhibit properties more commonly associated with humans. These included abilities such as playing games like tick-tack-toe, chess, and checkers, but also actions. As Wiener wrote, these actions would \u201ctake into consideration not merely the moves as they occurred in the individual game but the record of games previously played.\u201d  \n  \nAt the time, the article and its related work set off the study of cybernetics, a research endeavor that brings control theory, computation, logic, and biology together into a cohesive theory of intelligent systems. Although intelligence itself was an ill-defined construct, the field began with a hope that what we describe as human cognition could be encoded in a machine.  \n  \nCybernetics took root at UC Berkeley. Professor Lotfi Zadeh, who taught computer science at UC Berkeley, introduced ideas such as fuzzy logic, an intersection of formal logic and probability theory to create \u201cfuzzy\u201d interpretations of the world. An example of this logic is an object\u2019s state of being hot or cold; Zadeh argued that this is not a binary property, but occurs along a gradient. Such \u201cfuzzy\u201d descriptions of the world allowed for more nuanced interpretations. Meanwhile, Professor Alfred Tarski, who taught mathematics at UC Berkeley, studied the foundations of modern logic, the study of truth, and the axioms that make up mathematics. Wiener\u2019s proposals regarding artificial intelligence required contributions from multiple disciplines because solving these new logical operations could not only signal a significant shift in human capabilities, but could also change the relationship that we have with technology. Rather than relying on technology that operated on a set of pre-programmed rules, the end goal was to develop systems that could operate on a flexible kind of logic that could adapt and learn.  \n  \nAs the decades went on, artificial intelligence researchers identified specific problems to solve in order to achieve logical thought in an artificial system. These problems included classification (categorizing objects into groups), decision-making (choosing between a set of alternatives), and prediction (forecasting the evolution of a system). The study of these problems brought together disparate fields like computing, economics, and philosophy.  \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/AI\\_feature\\_1.png) *Modern artificial intelligence exists at the intersection of many diverse fields, such as economics, philosophy, and computer science.*   \n  \nAt UC Berkeley, research centers such as Berkeley AI Research and the Center for Human-Compatible AI, as well as professors and students across departments like Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, Economics, and Philosophy have taken up the grand challenge of understanding the structure of intelligence to build real-world systems that exhibit properties like reasoning and cognition while also ensuring that their impact on the world is inherently good.  \n  \n# Economics: a strategic approach to complex systems  \n  \nAs researchers attempt to build computational systems with increasing capacity to impact the world, questions arise about the moral and technological challenges that accompany these processes. Today, these challenges range from designing autonomous vehicles that ensure the safety of both drivers and pedestrians to developing content recommendation services that reach hundreds of millions of people. Is there a way to build systems that are guaranteed to impact society positively? This very question, however, brings further uncertainties with it. To start, there is almost no universally acknowledged description of \u201cbeneficial\u201d in complex societal systems. For example, social networks connect large groups of people, but they also pose serious challenges through the rapid spread of misinformation. And, as an extension, even if there were a way to systemically define benefit and loss in a societal context, how could it be guaranteed that the system being designed was beneficial?  \n  \nEnter economics. The beginning of a complete theory of provably beneficial intelligence has its roots in understanding human preferences. Ideally, any autonomous intelligent agent should understand human priorities and preferences and be able to reason about them. However, human preferences have traditionally been regarded as fundamentally unobservable, as attempts to measure human preferences are limited to self-reported responses that may not adequately consider outside and subconscious influences.  \n  \nThe formal study of human decision making began in the 1940s with the work of John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, who put forth the beginnings of modern microeconomics. They studied the cases under which a decision made by an agent could be said to be \u201crational.\u201d The modern foundations of economics evolved in parallel with computer science and studied the allocation of scarce resources and decision-making by humans under various scenarios. In particular, the field of game theory (the study of strategy) originated as a response to problems that involved not only a single decision-maker, but also multiple humans strategizing with or against each other. Economic theory extended models of the preferences of a single human being to the study of aggregate populations of people.  \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/AI\\_feature\\_2a.png) *A principal-agent problem refers to an interaction between one human and one artificially intelligent system.*   \n  \nSimilarly, building intelligent systems can roughly be divided into what are called principal-agent problems and multi-agent problems. Principal-agent problems ask questions associated with a single human-being interacting with a single autonomous system. Multi-agent problems broaden this inquiry to either multiple humans or multiple intelligent systems.  \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/AI\\_feature\\_2b.png) *In a multiple-agent problem, AI interacts with multiple humans or other intelligent systems.*   \n  \nComputer scientists have borrowed ideas from economics to develop models of human decision-making in large-scale societal systems. These include the study of congestion patterns in traffic and autonomous driving, efficiency of markets and networks, and the structure of institutions. These real-world systems are important because autonomous systems with many interacting components have properties that are unintuitive. Scientists can therefore use models from economic theory to describe decision-making in these complex systems.  \n  \n# Choice and morality  \n  \nOne of the key challenges to understanding human decision making is that our preferences do not occur in a vacuum but are instead shaped by external factors. When an autonomous system attempts to learn human preferences, it may end up shifting or distorting them. In the Department of Philosophy at UC Berkeley, Professor Lara Buchak studies the foundations of rational choice and how we respond to suggestions. Economic theory attempts to identify how human beings make decisions, and rational choice is the long standing theory that underlies decision making. Buchak\u2019s 2013 book Risk and Rationality focuses on the choices that human beings make and suggests that the expected utility theory\u2014a predominant theory suggesting that humans do not always select the option that yields the highest personal reward\u2014is incomplete without a more thorough understanding of risk.  \n  \nBuchak starts her book with the question: \u201cWhat is good for some group of people?\u201d Uncertainty arises when we try to balance freedom of choice with improved outcomes in situations with many unknown variables. Buchak then provides an example: \u201cIf we are both choosing between apples and oranges, and I choose the apple because I like apples better than oranges, but you choose the apple because you think it would be really impolite of you to choose this delicious orange, we have made the same choice but for different reasons.\u201d It is entirely possible in this scenario that preferences do not correctly map to choices at all.  \n  \nResearchers are now trying to translate the uncertainty of human preferences to artificial intelligence. Professor Stuart Russell\u2019s group from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) is taking on the challenge of human preferences. They\u2019re specifically applying the ambiguity of human preferences to robotic systems. Russell brings up a distinction between what he calls the \u201cstandard model\u201d of AI and the modifications he proposes. The standard models of AI perform a small number of computations on a limited number of inputs and have largely hard-coded objectives that are specified by the human that designed the system. However, with the development of the field of deep learning, it is now commonplace to do many computations on each input.  \n  \n\u201cYou can think of a deep learning system as being a very large circuit that represents a complicated function,\u201d Russell says. \u201cIt is very hard to connect deep learning systems to a database, and in practice we need them to acquire a huge amount of data to achieve functionality to accomplish a task.\u201d Deep learning systems are typically composed of neural networks, which are essentially a series of algorithms processing a numerical representation of some input, connected with values called \u201cweights\u201d that are adjusted to indicate how inputs should be converted into the desired outputs. In effect, neural networks are general purpose tools that can approximate arbitrarily complicated functions that map inputs to output behavior. They are useful because of the wide range of behaviors they are able to exhibit. However, they also have many drawbacks.  \n  \nRussell mentions that humans have \u201ca vast library of hierarchical, behavioral structures,\u201d which can be deconstructed into individual physical actions. He notes that humans also build plans at \u201cdifferent levels of abstraction,\u201d but \u201cwhere those hierarchies come from is an open problem.\u201d Russell\u2019s current main area of research is the difference between the standard model of AI and what we want intelligent systems to do. The problems we see with typical AI models occur because we do not know how to specify objectives correctly. Because the standard AI model can only perform based on pre-programmed behaviors, if an intended objective was not properly included in the original code, the AI will not have the capacity to adjust its outputs to the correct behavior.  \n  \nThe lack of ability to adjust to new situations highlights the problem of objective misspecification in artificial intelligence. Say, for example that we have an autonomous robot that is built to bring us coffee. The only objective that is encoded in the robot is to deliver coffee to the human being, and the robot proceeds to fulfill this objective to the best of its ability. However, being completely unaware of the state of the rest of the world, the robot decides that the most efficient way of getting the most amount of coffee to the human being is to engage in destructive, criminal behavior and rob the nearest coffee shop. Russell calls this response the \u201cKing Midas problem,\u201d harking back to the Greek myth of a king who wished that everything he touch would turn to gold but forgot to make exceptions for things he did not want to be turned into gold.  \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/AI\\_feature\\_3.png) *If one were to order coffee from a robot unaware of human preferences, that robot could cause some damage accomplishing its singular objective.*   \n  \nThis example highlights the problem of runaway effects that can occur due to objective misspecification when building autonomous systems. The fact of the matter is, a robotic system does not have context about human morality, normative preferences, or the idea of value. These are completely external entities to the central problem that any modern intelligent system fundamentally solves, that is, maximizing the reward of accomplishing a task while minimizing the cost of performing the task.  \n  \nRussell\u2019s group has been working on devising a new theory of intelligent systems that relies on leaving the human preferences uncertain to the robot. It would seem to make more sense to inform the robot of all necessary information about the human user so they make as few mistakes as possible. However, the effect of Russell\u2019s approach is that the robot is forced to learn about instances in which it is misbehaving or not otherwise fulfilling the human intent that it was designed for. Furthermore, by having this ability to learn, it can go on to figure out preferences that may have been otherwise missed in the original coding of the system.  \n  \nRohin Shah, a researcher in Russell\u2019s group, works on the foundations of having robots understand human preferences and execute actions that are aligned with human intentions. Shah works on problems that involve robots inferring human preferences from actions. His research on correctly identifying preferences has helped formalize how robots should make decisions. Shah explains, \u201cHuman civilization has come this far because humans have the ability to learn from others and build on their work.\u201d Outside of his research in Russell\u2019s lab, he started the AI Alignment Newsletter \u201cas a sort of low-effort precursor to a textbook: it makes it easier for researchers to sift through all of the work being done to find whatever is most relevant to them.\u201d  \n  \nDylan Hadfield-Menell, a researcher in the Berkeley AI Research lab and Center for Human Compatible AI, also works on aligning the preferences of robots and humans. He introduced an early model in 2016 called \u201cCooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning,\u201d which is an attempt to formalize how agents can identify what each other wants cooperatively. In the case of designing AI systems, Hadfield-Menell explains that the term \u201cprovably beneficial\u201d comes from \u201csystems that are working with people to identify what their goals are, manage their uncertainty about what those goals are, and take actions that are provably aligned with their interests.\u201d Hadfield-Menell also studies the potential failure modes of current AI systems and cites the example of content recommendation. \u201cCompanies optimize over engagement, a measure of how long you spend on the site, [and] use a general purpose optimization algorithm with policies for showing content that you are likely to interact with,\u201d he explains. Although this seems, \u201cat first glance, a very reasonable thing to be doing, there are many negative externalities,\u201d he says. These externalities include the spread of misinformation on social networks, as well as a proliferation of conspiracies and other targeted content.  \n  \n# Verifying the quality of systems  \n  \nAs researchers develop systems to assist in our lives, they must formally verify the benefits of such systems in order for the systems to be adopted by the public. Having intelligent systems that can do their job well only in certain controlled scenarios is unsatisfactory for many critical applications. Consider autonomous vehicles, which are an important class of intelligent systems already commonly employed by the public. Engineers must prove they meet safety requirements and other critical characteristics. Much of the research into intelligent systems at UC Berkeley focuses on proving properties of these systems.  \n  \nProfessor Sanjit Seshia\u2019s lab in the EECS department studies formal methods and proofs to verify autonomous vehicle behavior and ensure safety for users. Seisha defines verified AI as \u201cthe goal of achieving high-assurance, and ideally provable AI.\u201d Recent AI systems are able to learn from experience, and researchers need to design intelligent systems with properties that can be mathematically proved as reliably true.  \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/AI\\_feature\\_4a.png) *The more data is input to an AI system, the more the system can be \u201ctrained\u201d to navigate human preferences.*   \n  \nSeshia proposes that instead of asking, \u201cwhat kinds of properties should these systems have?\u201d researchers should ask, \u201cwhat formalisms will allow us to express properties that users may want to write?\u201d In order to create beneficial systems, designers need a way to mathematically and computationally express the intended behaviors of the system\u2014this is known as the \u201cspecification problem.\u201d  \n  \nIt is also important to extend the properties from logic to deep learning models; for example, understanding the semantic meaning of a request. Seshia explains, \u201cSuppose there is an AI system that takes as an input a picture of a red car and is instructed to draw a bounding box around the car. If the color of the car changes from red to yellow, the pixels in the image have changed drastically, but the semantic meaning of the object should stay the same.\u201d This type of robustness is very desirable in designing AI systems for a world that is dynamic, changing, and uncertain.  \n  \nSeshia also notes that we need to be very careful about the software engineering and design process for machine learning and AI algorithms. \u201cOne of the core places where the design of machine learning algorithms is different from other systems is that the data set determines so much,\u201d he explains. Historically, the focus in designing systems was the design of the hardware, circuit, or architecture of the system. However, with machine learning and AI systems, there is a two-step procedure which involves training and testing. Training is the process in which data is fed to the system to determine the optimal parameters for the system to use. After the system is trained, the system goes through testing, in which it makes predictions on previously unseen data and is evaluated on its performance. Thus, the models that researchers are developing can only be as good as the information they give them. This process means a system with extensive data on human behavior will outperform a system that lacks such data.  \n  \n# Challenges and growth  \n  \nAs intelligent systems become ever more pervasive in society, it is becoming more and more important to consider safety and reliability of these systems as a critical design parameter. For example, having safety assurances for autonomous vehicles is very important in being able to properly account for accidents. Dr. Jaime Fisac, who worked on this topic during his PhD at UC Berkeley in the EECS department says, \u201cMany of the data-driven, learning-based techniques that we use for control and decision making do not have guarantees.\u201d Fisac also notes that \u201csome of the formulations from learning we are bringing into decision-based systems come from a field in which safety-critical systems are not a priority.\u201d  \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/AI\\_feature\\_4b.png) *As AI becomes more ingrained in our world, it will become increasingly important to standardize tests to ensure the safety of AI systems and their benefit to society.*   \n  \nTypically, reinforcement learning systems focus on optimizing for some average case outcome, but Fisac is interested in constraints on the system beyond this type of naive optimization. These could include safety constraints in vehicles or parts of the physical world that a robot should not be able to access in order to remain safe. Fisac has also studied the ways in which autonomous systems interact with human beings, especially in a \u201cgame theoretic\u201d setting, in which humans respond strategically to a system\u2019s actions. One challenge is to reason through the mutual strategic influence between the intelligent system and the human user. \u201cIn practice, people have expectations about the autonomous system and expectations about each other,\u201d Fisac notes about the interaction.  \n  \nHumans tend to underspecify their objectives and thus, when building systems of any complexity, we have a responsibility to show formal verification and correctness guarantees of the system. Already in daily life, we are seeing the impacts of systems that do not fit these specifications. Social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter have drawn plenty of criticism for their recommendation algorithms that optimize for engagement but at the same time seem to take away the autonomy of the user. And in the development of autonomous vehicles, there were reported cases of human fatalities when vehicles misclassified situations and did not stop for pedestrians when they should have.  \n  \nNorbert Wiener\u2019s vision of a feedback loop that generates intelligence has come a long way since the 1960s. The field has gone through many iterations and is poised to make an impact on the ways that we make decisions and understand preferences. This pursuit of studying human decision-making has led to the field internalizing and exploring ideas from many disciplines, including logic, economics, and of course, computer science. As AI systems make their way slowly from laboratories into the real world, engineers and researchers are striving to build robust, formally correct machines and algorithms. The introduction of modern learning technologies into everyday applications will require a more reliable theory of intelligence that is in line with human interests.  \n  \n-------   \n  \n*Kshitij Kulkarni is a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer sciences.*  \n  \n*Design: Santiago Yori*",

    "markdown":"Dear Readers,   \n  \nAs I write this letter, I am sitting in my kitchen at home (or sometimes on the couch) practicing social distancing to stop the spread of COVID-19. Like everyone else, I am thinking about when we can return to our normal lives and, like other scientists, how I miss being able to do the research that I love. Since I can\u2019t do science in person, I\u2019ve been consuming a lot of science news stories, especially those about coronavirus. I\u2019ve learned incredibly useful information from some of these articles and podcasts. But I\u2019ve also encountered many pieces full of dubious or confusing information, which has strengthened my belief that we need more good science writers who make their voices heard. The Berkeley Science Review strives to be an outlet for some of those writers.  \n  \nIn this issue, as always, the BSR features amazing research from many different scientific fields in an effort to demystify the important work Berkeley scientists do. \u201cBalancing the carbon budget\u201d discusses how oceans are able to pull carbon from the atmosphere, though not without complicated consequences. \u201cProvably beneficial artificial intelligence\u201d tackles the challenge of incorporating AI into human society. \u201cMonarch McFly: Back to the evolutionary future\u201d and \u201cInsect\u2019s repellent\u201d cover clever new ways of studying evolution. And \u201cSpace heater\u201d shows us that something thought to be physically impossible is real.  \n  \nI would also like to highlight an important celebration going on at UC Berkeley this year. It has been 150 years since the UC Regents resolved to consider applications from men and women equally. In solidarity with the Women 150 celebration, I invite the readers to reflect on all the discoveries and contributions women have made to the science covered in these pages. In particular, take a look at the Faculty Profiles to read about four of the amazing female professors at UC Berkeley: Mary K. Gaillard, Naomi Ginsberg, Dipti Nayak, and Priya Moorjani.  \n  \nAnd as you read through this issue of the Berkeley Science Review and enjoy the accompanying illustrations, I\u2019d like you to think of all the women who have contributed to making the BSR a fantastic publication over the years. There are a few women in particular that I\u2019d like to highlight for their hard work on the BSR this semester. Our Art Director, Emily Gonthier, has led our design team over the past year to produce two beautiful magazines and helped move the BSR forward as an organization. Maya Emmons-Bell, our Managing Editor, has kept the critical behind-the-scenes operations of the BSR running smoothly. Our stellar blog Editor in Chief, Emilia Zin, has worked tirelessly over the past few years to oversee the BSR blog and keep our website running smoothly.  \n  \nThis is Emilia\u2019s last semester with us and her shoes will be hard to fill. And lastly, Katie Deets has supported me in my transition to the role of Editor in Chief.  \n  \nI would like to extend huge thanks to everyone who contributed financially to the BSR this year. We greatly appreciate all of the donations received from individuals and campus departments. Every little bit is critical for us to keep printing the magazine and making our content accessible. Finally, thank you to the Karmon family, which has contributed to the BSR for many years. We are incredibly grateful to have your support.  \n  \nCheers to all the women scientists at UC Berkeley. And I hope all of our readers are staying well.  \n  \nEnjoy Issue 38 of the *Berkeley Science Review*!  \n  \n",

She formed the Bay Area chapter of the [Association for Women in Mathematics](https:\/\/awm-math.org\/) (AWM) and later became the third president of AWM. In part 1 of 2, Lenore tells us about growing up and finding her passion for math in Caracas, earning her PhD from MIT, and moving to Berkeley and becoming an accidental activist.   \n  \n**Amanda Glazer: Can you start by telling us about when you first became interested in math?**   \n  \n**Lenore Blum:** I was born in New York City (NYC) and lived there until I was nine, then my family moved to Caracas, Venezuela. When we arrived, my parents decided to put me and my seven-year-old sister in a Venezuelan school. We had gone to a very progressive school in NYC where you didn\u2019t know your grades. In those years, public schools in NY were very progressive.   \n  \nThis school in Caracas was small and very disciplined. They put me back two grades because the system was very different. That did not sit too well with me. Also, it was very rigid. The *profesora* would write something on the board, which we had to copy many times into our *cuadernos* (notebooks) and then draw beautiful pictures.   \n  \nOne day the principal decided to teach these two little girls [me and my sister] Spanish. The lesson was about the subjunctive case. We had had no grammar in NYC so starting with the subjunctive case was difficult.   \n  \nThe other part that was difficult for me was that the boys had learned a little English from movies, American movies, that was a big thing. So, they\u2019d circle around me and my sister and say all the English words they knew like \u201cI love you.\u201d It was very embarrassing. So, one day I told my mom, who had been a science teacher in NYC (at the Bronx High School of Science), I didn\u2019t want to go back. For some reason she said fine, you don\u2019t have to go back to school and took me and my sister out.   \n  \nI had a great year. We spent every day exploring the city. My mom discovered that if you take the bus down to the center of town, which is called *El Silencio* (due to a plague in the 1600s that had wiped out the neighborhood), you could then take other buses that would take you distant places in the city and then bring you back.   \n  \nAt the time, there was a large Jewish community, and also a large American community, in Caracas. My dad had gotten us a place to live in the Jewish community (*San Bernardino*) where there were many European immigrants. There was a cafe in the hospital that was near our house where you could get ice cream sodas and European pastries. At the end of the day after our bus trips we would end up there with all these ladies, sitting and having coffee. I was nine and a half by then. It was just so much fun. I loved it.   \n  \nEven though my mom was a teacher, she didn\u2019t home-school us. In retrospect, that surprises me, but I think she assumed we would pick things up easily. In a way she demystified me about school. I was never worried about school because I could see her grading papers. I saw that it was not the most precise kind of scary thing.   \n  \nAt the end of the year my parents had to decide where to send us back to school. There was an American School (*Campo Alegre*) in Caracas which was run by the oil companies. In those years (the 50s) the country\u2019s natural resources were controlled by foreign companies (that\u2019s one root of the problems that Venezuela faces today, *but by no means* the only one). Oil was the main resource that supported the country and the oil companies were mostly run by Americans, but also by the British and Dutch, like Shell. There were about 70,000 Americans in Venezuela at the time.   \n  \nThe American School was very expensive if you weren\u2019t employed by the oil companies, which my family was not. My mother got a job teaching junior high science at the school, and because of that, my sister and I were able to attend.1 And that\u2019s how I became an American \u2013 in Caracas. In NYC we had lived in a very Jewish community, a kind of intellectual, academic enclave. I hardly knew anyone who wasn\u2019t Jewish. And now my classmates were from Texas, Oklahoma, California, Montana, with parents in the oil companies and access to all sorts of American fashions. I learned about pop music and Elvis Presley, which my cousins in NYC knew little about.   \n  \nI was really excited to go back to school after being out for a year. The first day, they were doing some mathematics, not just long division, but something more like the Euclidean algorithm. I thought this was fantastically interesting. I caught on immediately and from that day on I loved mathematics. I was one of the best students, but in math especially. Maybe I was a good student before but because they never gave us grades in NYC, you never knew where you stood.   \n  \nRecently I looked at [Julia Robinson](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Julia\\_Robinson)\u2019s biography for a talk that I was preparing for (what would have been) her 100th birthday. As a youngster, due to illness, she missed a couple of years of school. I know of other mathematicians who also missed a year or more of elementary school for one reason or other. After missing school for one year, I came back with such enthusiasm that it changed my life. I think that elementary schools in the United States tend to repeat things year after year. I didn\u2019t experience that, and so I wasn\u2019t bored to tears. (I wonder what the effect will be now on all the students out of school due to \u201csheltering in place.\u201d Probably mixed, but surely someone is studying this.)   \n  \nI had a lot of friends and I was never put down for being good at math. I think that being \u201cother\u201d gives one a lot of freedom, and also can serve as buffer. I was \u201cother\u201d in lots of ways, which I saw as an advantage then, and later on.   \n  \n**AG: You graduated from high school in Venezuela?**   \n  \n**LB:** I did. *Campo Alegre* didn\u2019t have a high school at the time, and many of the American kids went back to boarding schools in the States. That was typical, but I did not. There was an international high school (called *Colegio Americano*) that was run by Presbyterian missionaries. That\u2019s where I went for high school. I was still really good in math and skipped so many classes that I was able to graduate from high school when I was barely 16.2   \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment\\\\_17608\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"510\"][![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/In-high-school-in-Caracas-dad\\_sister\\_lenore\\_mom-1-720x450.jpg)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/In-high-school-in-Caracas-dad\\_sister\\_lenore\\_mom-1.jpg) Lenore\u2019s father, her sister, herself, and her mother in Caracas when Lenore was in high school.[\/caption]   \n  \nI remember being in a trig class and seeing the proof of a theorem and thinking to myself how beautiful it was. Very early on I felt that math was beautiful. And that proofs were beautiful and, of course, that they were independent of anybody\u2019s interpretation or feelings. I think that\u2019s another attraction for people who go into math. Later on, you find out that there\u2019s a lot of faddism. You know, areas of math become fashionable, and then not\u2014and vice versa. But at the time, it just seemed so pure and independent of people\u2019s personal views\u2014I loved that and the beauty of it.   \n  \nSo, when I was going to apply to college, I asked my high school math teacher if I should major in mathematics. He told me, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d But not because I was a girl. He said all the best mathematics had been done 2,000 years ago. Later on, I realized that my teacher was a missionary teaching geometry, that he probably didn\u2019t know more math than that. So, for him, Euclid was the best mathematician. Since I didn\u2019t want to go into a dead field, I decided to study architecture. I still loved math, but I was also a pretty good artist. I\u2019d done many sets for school plays. As a child, art was my biggest hobby, making all sorts of things out of construction paper and such. I made my own toys and I always drew.   \n  \nCaracas is a beautiful tropical city, high in the valley between two mountain ranges, one to the north and one to the south. At the time, it had some of the most beautiful modern architecture in the world. There were concrete cantilever houses overlooking the city and huge Calder mobiles in the *Aula Magna* of the *Universidad Central*. Many Italian and Spanish people had come to Venezuela to work in the booming building industry. They then became these fantastic construction architects. A lot of interesting modern Italian architecture started in Venezuela.   \n  \nI applied to MIT, that\u2019s where I wanted to go. But then I got a letter back saying all freshmen (!) had to live on campus and they only had 20 beds for women. That was 1959. That story is interesting because four years later, [Katharine McCormick](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Katharine\\_McCormick), a feminist and philanthropist who had graduated from MIT very early (in 1904), gave MIT a million dollars, which was a lot of money then, to build a women\u2019s dorm. When she died, she left funds in her will to build an annex. So, they did. Then the rules changed, entering women no longer had to live on campus. This is an example of a woman who changed things\u2014lack of dormitory space had been one of the excuses given to exclude women.   \n  \n**So where did you go to college?**   \n  \nI went to Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie Mellon), which is in Pittsburgh. I started in architecture. During my first year, I was an intern at an architectural firm, and I saw all the young people just drafting away on someone else\u2019s plans. All we were doing, the art we were doing, was drafting, which was not very appealing to me. And the math was math for architects, mainly formulas for stress and strain \u2013 not the math I was looking for. So, I tried to switch to the Math Department. Architecture was in the School of Fine Arts and Math was in the Engineering School. To switch from Fine Arts to Engineering was not an easy thing to do. This was my second year, so I was just 17 then. I started asking professors and deans, \u201ccan I transfer?\u201d And everyone said, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d But then I finally got lucky: one day I knocked on a math professor\u2019s door and said, \u201cI want to switch to math, can you help me?\u201d To my surprise he responded, \u201cOh, fantastic! I\u2019m giving this experimental class in computers with the computer in the basement of the business school (it was an IBM 650). The class has been going on for a while, but never mind. The computer will grade all your homework.\u201d This was [Alan Perlis](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alan\\_Perlis) who became the first head of computer science (CS) at Carnegie Mellon, the first head of CS at Yale and the first Turing award winner. He was the first in many things. I\u2019ve always found that people who are really good at what they do are much more open.   \n  \nSo, that\u2019s how I switched to mathematics, by taking this computer course, which was mainly a problem-solving course. I have lots of computer stories about that. You know decks of IBM cards, original hackers. and all that. I learned how to program in machine language, really, down to the 0s and 1s, the bits. But still I wanted to study real mathematics.   \n  \nThat summer, I got married and moved to Boston. There\u2019s a parallel story about my husband, Manuel, who was at MIT.   \n  \n**How did you meet him?**   \n  \nHe\u2019s Venezuelan. I met him in Caracas when I was 10 or 11. That\u2019s part of my Caracas story. During that first year in Venezuela, we met many Jewish families. My mother was a friend of his mother\u2019s and we met at his house. He always tells the story of our meeting in some glamorous romantic way which always embarrasses me. He was four years older than me. He was my idol because he was interested in so many of the things that I was interested in, and he was very different from my classmates at school. We corresponded over the years, mainly during my last year of high school. He graduated from college when I graduated from high school and came back to Caracas for my graduation. We spent that summer together going to bookstores and buying philosophy and math books. His first gift to me was Thomas\u2019 *Calculus*.   \n  \nWhen I moved to Boston, I didn\u2019t even try to apply to MIT. I transferred to Simmons College, a women\u2019s college. There was this wonderful math teacher there. She said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have anything to do here, let\u2019s get you into MIT.\u201d So, Simmons paid for me to be a special student at MIT. I took the course I had been looking for my whole life. I had always been looking for a real math course with a mathematician who was doing research and really knew their stuff. I didn\u2019t know that at the time, but I knew what I was looking for and I knew I didn\u2019t get it in any of my other classes. The teacher was [Isadore (Is) Singer](https:\/\/math.mit.edu\/directory\/profile.php?pid=249). He\u2019s in his 90s now. He\u2019s one of the most famous people at MIT in math. His course was just so beautiful. The first semester it was algebra, but the most abstract. The second semester it was linear algebra, but really abstract linear algebra. We never saw any equations. It was the beautiful underlying theory and pretty advanced.   \n  \nWhen it was time for me to apply to graduate school, I finally got the nerve to apply to MIT again.   \n  \n**Had you known for a while that you were going to apply to graduate school?**   \n  \nI always wanted to. So, I tried again to apply to MIT. I remember going for an interview with the head of the Math Department in his office. As I walked in, he handed me a list of schools and said, \u201cif I had a daughter who was going to graduate school, these are the places I\u2019d tell her to go. MIT is not a place for women.\u201d They clearly did not want me there. That was devastating. (Many years later when I was teaching at Berkeley, I got a brochure from MIT announcing, \u201cMIT is a place for women.\u201d3)   \n  \nBut then, I got a \u201clucky\u201d break. The next Saturday the MIT Math Department had a faculty party. Somehow, at the party they were joking about this girl who was applying to the PhD program in mathematics. Can you imagine? Why would they even bring it up? Is Singer was there and he asked, \u201cwho are you talking about?\u201d They gave my name and he said, \u201cOh! She\u2019s the best student in my class.\u201d I got accepted the next day.   \n  \nSome of these \u201clucky\u201d breaks come with their own troubles. The trouble with this one was I felt so grateful that I \u201cneeded\u201d to show them that, of course, they had made the right decision. But also, I was excited that finally, I was given the opportunity to take substantive math courses. So, I started graduate school with a bang, taking eight really high-level courses. Of course, there\u2019s no way to take eight courses (my husband, who was also a graduate student at MIT never took more than one or two courses a semester) so I started dropping them one by one. A real downer. Not a great way to start my graduate career.   \n  \nActually, MIT was a pretty good place to be. Once you're in, the faculty more or less treated you as equal, perhaps because they assumed you\u2019d be a future colleague. MIT\u2019s an especially great place for undergraduates, better than Harvard in that way. For example, many years later Is called me up to tell me excitedly, \u201cGuess what, I\u2019ve been asked to TA for calculus.\u201d MIT has top people teaching undergraduates \u2013 and their top people are excited to do that.   \n  \nI liked algebra from Is\u2019s course, so I started taking more algebra classes including Algebraic Geometry and Number Theory. My graduate advisor was a pretty famous Number Theorist named Kenkichi Iwasawa. He was one of my PhD oral examiners. But as soon as I finished my exams and started working on my thesis with him, he took a position at Princeton. In those years women weren\u2019t allowed at Princeton, so if I even wanted to, I couldn\u2019t follow him there.4 Of course, his male students could. There was no internet at the time. Talking to him on the phone was very difficult, and expensive.   \n  \nIwasawa\u2019s leaving was pretty hard on me, but another really lucky thing happened. I became the main TA for a new course that a logic professor, Hartley Rogers, was teaching. It was on model theory and it was on some very new research that was happening in model theory then, taking logic in a very sophisticated way and applying it to mathematics\u2014to algebra, number theory and other areas of mathematics I knew about. So, I was able to see the connection between the two. There were some really great results coming from people at Cornell \u2013 Jim Ax, Simon Kochen, Michael Morley. Because I had the algebra and model theory, I was the main person at MIT to study these results and became the go-to person for anyone who wanted to find out what was going on, including Gian-Carlo Rota and a new faculty member who had just come to MIT, Gerald Sacks. Sacks asked me to be his student, so that was a big change. Using some of the sophisticated model theory I was able to get new results in differential algebra, including some that others said were not possible. I became well known for the work I did in my thesis. Some of the Cornell and Harvard folks came to MIT for my thesis defense. I had gotten into the groove by then. It was really, very good.   \n  \n**What did you do after you got your PhD?**   \n  \nWhen I got my PhD in 1968, I had a fellowship, a postdoc, and I could go anywhere in the country. With the enthusiasm at MIT for my thesis, and my postdoc fellowship, I thought, \u201cOk I can go anywhere, and people will surely appreciate my work.\u201d I did not know that one needs mentors and support structures. It did not even dawn on me that that was something that I should be looking for. That I should go to a place where they already liked my research.   \n  \nI decided to go to Berkeley. One of the reasons was that Berkeley is in California, and it reminded me a lot of Caracas. For one the weather, for another, the politics. In high school I was kind of a revolutionary. We had a dictator who was overthrown along with the military police. High school and college students took on the role of patrolling the streets. So, Berkeley sounded like coming home. But even more, Julia Robinson was there. Her research bridged logic and algebra and her paper, \u201cThe Decision Problem for Fields\u201d, had been a mainstay on my desk while I was working on my thesis. I was looking forward to working with her.   \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment\\\\_17616\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"454\"][![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/1968BerkeleyProfLotfiZader\\_Zadeh-House-720x450.jpg)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/1968BerkeleyProfLotfiZader\\_Zadeh-House.jpg) Lenore with her husband and son in Berkeley in 1968.[\/caption]   \n  \nWhen I arrived in Berkeley in 1968, I was shocked that Julia5 was not on the math faculty\u2014never had a regular faculty position there. Every so often when they needed help, she was asked to teach. Since Julia signed her papers Berkeley, California, and because of her prominence, I, and everyone else I knew, thought she was on the faculty. I also found out that the Math Department hadn\u2019t hired a woman in a regular position in 20 or 30 years. I was totally unprepared for this and underestimated its implications for me.   \n  \nIn 1968, a little after I came to Berkeley, I was offered an assistant professorship at Yale, by Abraham Robinson, one of the mathematicians who liked my research. It had helped position his work on model theory and algebra in a more modern direction. That would have been (one of) the first tenure-track appointments for a woman in a major math department in the country. I did not take it. My husband was already tenured in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) at Berkeley and I did not want to leave him. And we had a two-year-old. The chair and the vice-chair of the Berkeley Math Department offered me a lectureship. They told me the position was comparable with the assistant professorship at Yale. Still totally na\u00efve and optimistic I accepted.   \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment\\\\_17609\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"314\"][![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/yale.jpg)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/yale.jpg) The letter Lenore received offering her an Assistant Professorship in the Department of Mathematics at Yale.[\/caption]   \n  \nAs I said earlier, with my postdoc fellowship I had thought I could go anywhere, and people would surely appreciate my work. But I soon found out that the Berkeley logic folks did not. People were like, \u201cUh, what is she doing here?\u201d At the time, they valued the theory of large cardinals, set theory, pure logic. Applied logic was viewed in the same way as applied math was at the time, not as deep as pure logic or pure math. For similar reasons I believe they didn\u2019t take Julia Robinson\u2019s work seriously \u2013 she was combining logic with mathematics.   \n  \nA similar prejudice was brewing towards the new field of theoretical computer science. Steve Cook, the founder of the theory of NP-completeness in the West, was on the logic faculty when I arrived. The year I came he was not given tenure. They didn\u2019t see any future to his work, so he went to Toronto. The P\/NP question is now recognized as one of the deepest questions in logic.   \n  \nThe kinds of things I was interested in, this combo of math and logic, number theory, complexity, computer science and logic \u2013 the logicians did not see that as real stuff. (An irony for me is coming back to Berkeley this year and attending logic seminars and colloquia, I find that the area I worked in over 50 years ago, applying sophisticated model theory to mathematics, is now central to logic there.)   \n  \nI taught at Berkeley for two years. The first year I taught the undergraduate logic course and the second, I taught this fantastic three-quarter graduate course in logic (Berkeley was on the trimester system then). It was a wonderful class, lots of fun, the students were great, and many became quite famous. But also, that was the year it became very clear I wasn\u2019t going to be rehired.   \n  \nAnd that was the year I became an accidental activist.   \n  \n*[Click here](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/2020\/05\/an-accidental-activist-part-2\/) for Part 2.*   \n  \n1 My mom was a popular teacher, more than I realized at the time. A recent Facebook photo post by one of the school\u2019s alumni, elicited comments including: Mrs. Epstein\u2019s class was something to look forward to so hands-on. She encouraged exploration, journaling and observation, all the important things in STEM education I value. She was my science teacher 1963-1966; I remember her ... she was wonderful; I never again had a better teacher than Mrs. Epstein! I still have my science notebook from her class!   \n  \n2 I was co-valedictorian of my high school class with Vivette Caspi (now Girault). She was the other person who excelled in math and we became friends and study partners. We lost touch for many years until several years ago she wrote me that she was a math professor in Paris (I had no idea) and would be on sabbatical at Carnegie Mellon. Over the years, we had been at many places and conferences together, but never knew it!   \n  \n3 The photo on the brochure cover was of Norwegian mathematician Ragni Piene, a graduate student in algebraic geometry at the time. Later we became friends.   \n  \n4 Princeton opened up to women the year I got my PhD from MIT, which was 1968, the year of many revolutions. During that period MIT was open to women, but reluctantly.   \n  \n5 Eight years later in 1976, after being (the first woman mathematician) elected to the National Academy of Sciences, Julia Robinson was offered a professorship in the Berkeley Math Department. She accepted on her terms, teaching \u00bc time. Julia was 57 years old the time. One of the reasons the university gave for not hiring Julia (and other women) in regular positions was the nepotism (or more precisely, anti-nepotism) rule. As far as I know, only women were affected by such rules at the university \u2013 and many were. In effect, nepotism was an official mechanism to discriminate against women since many were married to men in similar fields. The stipulation was that it could be overridden on recommendation of the department head. I don\u2019t know if it ever was. At Berkeley, the rule was rescinded in 1971.   \n  \nFeatured image: Dr. Lenore Blum in her office in Evans Hall, UC Berkeley.",

    "markdown":"*This article is part of STEMinism in the Spotlight, a monthly interview series.*   \n  \n[In part 1 of 2](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/2020\/05\/an-accidental-activist-part-1\/), Lenore told us about growing up and finding her passion for math in Caracas, earning her PhD from MIT, and moving to Berkeley and becoming an accidental activist. In part 2 of the interview, Lenore tells us about her work as an activist, her research at Carnegie Mellon and her advice for women in STEM.   \n  \n**Amanda Glazer: How did you become an \"accidental activist\"?**   \n  \nLenore Blum: Before Berkeley, I had not particularly identified with women scientists. In fact, at MIT I remember being very happy when they wrote letters addressing me as \u201cMr. Blum\u201d because I thought, well finally, I\u2019m accepted. Of course, this was outrageous, but other women at MIT told me exactly the same thing. Having blinders on has the positive effect of not taking things personally. But of course, having blinders on does not prepare you to deal with the bigger issues I faced when I got to Berkeley. I had no tools. I didn\u2019t have those support structures. And I didn\u2019t realize I needed it.   \n  \nIn the Berkeley tradition, those years were very political: Vietnam, People\u2019s Park, Cambodia \u2026 Three faculty in the Math Department (Moe Hirsch, John Rhodes and Steve Smale) started a colloquium series on math and social responsibility. They asked me to talk about women in mathematics. I said, \u201cWell I really don\u2019t know anything about women in mathematics.\u201d So I put a panel together: Sheila Johannsen, a historian at Berkeley who knew about the history of women in mathematics; [Ravenna Helson](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ravenna\\_Helson), a psychologist who had done a study on women mathematicians and the creative personality; and [Betty Scott](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elizabeth\\_Scott\\_(mathematician)), who was head of the Statistics Department and a friend of mine. A couple years before she had published a report, *Report on the Subcommittee on the Status of Academic Women on the Berkeley Campus.* It was a fantastic statistical study because it was not just the data (which she had), but also included stories and analysis. It really was the first thing I read that made sense to me about what was happening. I didn\u2019t ask Julia Robinson to speak because I didn\u2019t want to put her on the spot, but she came and sat right in front.   \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment\\\\_17623\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"355\"][![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/flyer.jpg)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/flyer.jpg) Flyer advertising the colloquium Lenore organized on \"Social Problems Connected with Mathematics\" in 1971.[\/caption]   \n  \nThe event was packed. After that I became known as *the expert* on women in mathematics \u2013 at least on the West Coast \u2013 and many of the women graduate students started congregating around me. Judy Roitman was a graduate student then. We became great friends. She cheered me on then and has cheered me on over the years. I became active in the newly formed Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) and by the next year we formed the Bay Area chapter. (This predates the [Noetherian Ring](https:\/\/nring.math.berkeley.edu\/).) I became the third president of the AWM.   \n  \nThe AWM will have its 50th Anniversary in 2021. It has been the key organization for exposing discrimination of women mathematicians in academia, at Berkeley and elsewhere, providing testimony to Congress, and has been the main force for positive change in the mathematics community.   \n  \n**Did you enjoy doing all that?**   \n  \nYou know, it\u2019s interesting. I never saw myself in this role but was amazed at how good I was.   \n  \nActually, I played a super important role because many of the people who were advocating for women in science (we didn\u2019t have STEM in our vocabulary then) were not in science themselves. They were usually in women\u2019s studies departments. A lot of the women\u2019s studies groups were dealing with feelings about mathematics, what was called \u201cmath anxiety\u201d (rather than giving people mathematical tools): what\u2019s your feeling about mathematics? What experiences turned you off?   \n  \nI was pretty well known in the math community and was frequently invited to talk to heads of math departments across the country. I recommended things that made sense and resonated with them: figure out ways to get women quickly into regular math courses.   \n  \nIn 1973 there was a study done on the Berkeley campus by then graduate student Lucy Sells. She found that only 8 percent of women (compared to 57 percent of men) entering college had enough high school math to take calculus.6 That meant that women entering Berkeley most likely could not major in any of the STEM fields or even the technical parts of other fields. The study, titled \u201cHigh School Math as the Critical Filter in the Job Market\u201d, hit the nail on the head.   \n  \nSo why don\u2019t you design a college-level course, not a remedial course, that gets students into calculus quickly no matter their background? That is what I did at Mills College.   \n  \nI actually started the Math\/Computer Science Department at Mills in 1973. They had hired me as a substitute for a faculty on leave. I wrote a white paper on what I saw that a women\u2019s college could do. It got circulated, people in the Advancement Office really like it. They sent the proposal to the San Francisco Foundation and got funding for it. Then I got fired from Mills. The dean thought I was turning it into a technological school. But the Mills College president had some professors from Stanford on his board, and they immediately offered me the opportunity to head a new department of Math and Computer Science at Mills. Later I was awarded the first Letts-Villard Chair which had a $1 million endowment. A lot of money at the time.   \n  \nI also started to meet women with like-minded ideas, like Nancy Kreinberg at the Lawrence Hall of Science. She was running a program for girls called \u201cMath for Girls\u201d, (presenting girls with math activities and taught by women students in math and engineering at Berkeley) and later teacher training programs (Math Equals) and great math materials for kids and their parents (Family Math). Through Nancy, I started to understand what the teachers were doing and got a lot of respect for them. At the time, many mathematicians poo-pooed math teachers. I was able to be a bridge person between math researchers and math teachers. (Years later when I was Deputy Director of MSRI, I was able to start a program, \u201cConversations between Math Researchers and Math Teachers\u201d, building on my earlier relationships.)   \n  \nIn 1974, Nancy and I became co-founding directors of what\u2019s called the Math\/Science Network. I don\u2019t know if you know the conferences, [Expanding Your Horizons](https:\/\/www.ocf.berkeley.edu\/~eyh\/) (EYH)? The Network started them to provide role models, positive hands on experiences, and career information about STEM for middle and high school girls. The conferences have been going on all these years, across the country, serving close to a million girls. (At Carnegie Mellon, some of my students told me that they, and earlier their mothers, had attended EYH conferences.) I noticed that Berkeley sponsored an [EYH conference](https:\/\/www.ocf.berkeley.edu\/~eyh\/) this spring.   \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment\\\\_17626\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"185\"][![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/mathScienceNetwork.jpg)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/mathScienceNetwork.jpg) Math Science Network conference brochure from 1978.[\/caption]   \n  \nThat redirected a lot of my life back then. I saw early on that it was how my political activity would be channeled. But I rationalized that I\u2019d be able to do mathematics as well. On the other hand, to do these things well, and be effective, you can\u2019t just do it on the side. You have to pay attention to what\u2019s working, who are the right people to work with, all of these things. So, it took over a whole lot of my life.   \n  \n**What were some of the next research projects you worked on?**   \n  \nIn the 80s I started to work with my husband on cryptographically secure pseudorandom sequences. On the one hand, these sequences are pseudorandom, not random, since they are generated by an algorithm. On the other hand, any information you wanted to get from these sequences would take too long to compute and so for all intents and purposes, they behave like random sequences: any test that you could run in polynomial time would not allow you to tell the difference between truly random sequences and these pseudorandom sequences. The key is to embed a very hard problem (re: complexity theory) into the decryption of these sequences, i.e., that would be solved upon decryption. The sequences that we were generating were very interesting. Starting with a small random seed *x*, you generate a sequence simply by successively squaring mod *n*, where *n* had certain properties, and then taking the least significant bit or most significant bit of each result to generate a sequence of 0s and 1s. I had told Steve Smale about these methods and he said, \u201cyou know, I had a student who worked on the dynamics of squaring on the circle.\u201d That was Mike Shub. \u201cAnd you should talk to Mike about it.\u201d I had known Mike from my Boston days since he was on the faculty at Brandeis while I was a grad student and had met him once or twice. So, I contacted Mike and we started to realize the discrete version of the Bernoulli shifts that he had been working on were not cryptographically secure. In fact, with little information, you could easily start generating them. We three wrote a paper and our cryptographically secure squaring pseudo random sequence became known as the Blum, Blum, Shub sequences.   \n  \nAt the same time, I was on a National Science Foundation (NSF) committee where we were looking for ways to bring women scientists back into research. We devised a program called \u201cVisiting Professorships for Women (VPW)\u201d that would give women scientists, who were typically at smaller teaching schools, a year visiting more research centered institutions. The professorships would be a full salary for a year and the universities would get the usual overhead rate, possibly 50 percent. Usually NSF grants are for two months\u2019 summer salary, but these were 12-month grants. So, for example, if you have a grant for a $100,000 12-month salary it could end up being $200,000 and the university would get $100,000. Universities realized this very quickly. So, the grants became very prestigious and many universities vied to get a VPW on their staff.   \n  \nOne day, I got a call from Mike, he\u2019s in NYC at the Graduate Center and at IBM. He tells me about a program called Visiting Professorships for Women and that \u201cI think you\u2019d be perfect for it.\u201d I was kind of shocked because I\u2019d never envisioned myself as beneficiary of a program I was helping develop. But I applied and I got a VPW. So that\u2019s how I re-entered the research enterprise in the mid 80s. From this program, I went to NYC. I did it over a two-year period because my son was still in high school. That\u2019s when I started working with Mike and then later with Steve Smale on models of computation over continuous domains. Without that NSF grant I wouldn\u2019t have had the year off to focus on research.   \n  \nWhen I started doing more research, a new president of Mills College asked me, \u201cWell, you\u2019re doing lots of research, what are you doing for us these days?\u201d I thought that was really ironic. I decided to resign a tenured position so I could do more research and took a position at the [International Computer Science Institute](https:\/\/www.icsi.berkeley.edu\/icsi\/) in Berkeley. That\u2019s when my research started taking off again in a totally new area. Everything I\u2019ve done, when I look back, was bridging different areas. For my thesis it was logic, model theory and algebra. With these computational models it was logic and computer science. That work took off and became foundational for what\u2019s called Computational Mathematics. We wrote our book, *Complexity and Real Computation*, and that got me back in the groove.   \n  \nWhen we wrote the book, I was in Hong Kong. My son was a professor at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). My grandkids were in Pittsburgh. When Carnegie Mellon invited us to come (as they had various times before), I thought, \u201cWell Berkeley: been there, done that. Let\u2019s try Pittsburgh.\u201d And that\u2019s when we agreed to go to CMU in 1999. We were at CMU for 20 years.   \n  \n**How was your experience in Pittsburgh?**   \n  \nMy life took another turn in Pittsburgh. I was co-heading an NSF center called [Aladdin](http:\/\/www.aladdin.cs.cmu.edu\/) that was looking at the synergy between algorithm *theory* and algorithm *practice*, a very Carnegie Mellon thing. It was really exciting because we were seeing how basic core algorithms had many different applications, for example from heart assist pumps to logistics and power management.   \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment\\\\_17620\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"288\"][![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Lenore-CMU-1.jpg)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Lenore-CMU-1.jpg) Lenore at CMU.[\/caption]   \n  \nWe had one of the largest grants in the theory community and were able to support many of our faculty\u2019s PhD students. Then one day, NSF discarded the program (called Information Technology Research), not just ours but the whole program. I realized that without the center funding, everyone would be competing with each other to get grants. So, I had this cool idea which was totally naive but turned out to be really interesting. I said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we commercialize some of our projects and bring money back to research?\u201d This is naive, how are you going to commercialize quickly enough to bring money back to research? And I didn\u2019t know anything about business. So, what I started to do was have these show and tell events showcasing the research we were doing and some of the suggestions of startups. I was really lucky to meet two women in Pittsburgh who helped publicize my first event. One headed an angel funding group and another who was writing for the *Business Times*. As a consequence, although I knew virtually no one in the business community, practically all the folks in Pittsburgh who were interested in innovation and entrepreneurship came. They\u2019d rarely been to talks at Carnegie Mellon before because there was little opportunity, and then all of a sudden, I became the center of this thing. I founded an innovation center on campus called Project Olympus, and headed it for many years. Pittsburgh now is a huge hub for startups. One of our companies became the first homebred unicorn, it\u2019s [Duolingo](https:\/\/www.duolingo.com\/). So, I was in both the entrepreneurial world and the research world.   \n  \nThere are many differences between the business community and the research community that can cause a lot of tension but can also provide lessons for each other. As an example, in entrepreneurship, good enough is often good enough. In the research community, good enough is *not* good enough. But researchers have to know when they are stuck and then to keep moving on. It\u2019s not the be all or end all. And entrepreneurs need to be wary of good enough is good enough, particularly now that we see so many startups claiming they are using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) and they may not know what they\u2019re talking about.   \n  \n**What is your latest research?**   \n  \nI\u2019m working with Manuel again. Our newest research is on designing a computer architecture for a conscious AI based on cognitive neuroscience. We are taking the work of the cognitive neuroscientists, in particular Bernard Baar\u2019s Theater Model that we think is really great, and mathematizing it. We call it the Conscious Turing Machine. As mathematicians and computer scientists, we are inspired by Turing\u2019s simple model of computation, to design a simple mathematical model of consciousness. We\u2019re not modelling the brain, just consciousness. A Turing machine is a very simple entity and yet it can compute any function that any machine can compute. You can get your head around the Turing machine, you can\u2019t get your head around the cloud or a supercomputer. We are trying to do the same for our model. To have it be as simple as possible so you can start proving theorems, and give us some insight into consciousness. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing since I\u2019ve been here at Berkeley, since December, full time. So that\u2019s my research now. And our son Avrim is involved also so we are writing our first Blum, Blum, Blum paper!   \n  \n[caption id=\"attachment\\\\_17622\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"277\"][![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Lenore-Manuel-1-1.png)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Lenore-Manuel-1-1.png) Lenore and her husband, Manuel.[\/caption]   \n  \n**Any last advice?**   \n  \nOkay, so, lessons for you? It\u2019s really important to have mentors and be in a community supportive of your work. I would say that\u2019s the most important thing. You can\u2019t do it on your own. Nobody does it on their own. That\u2019s a myth. I don\u2019t think mathematics is just done in isolation. It\u2019s done in social\/professional communities.   \n  \nI remember a *Wall Street Journal* article, a number of years ago, where they mentioned me. They said, (my paraphrasing), \u201cWhen Lenore Blum was deputy director at the Math Science Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, she noticed that on Mondays mathematicians at MSRI would come in with new results. When one of the mathematicians told her \u2018oh we spent the weekend on the Bay\u2019 she realized that over the weekend visiting male mathematicians might rent a sailboat, have fun, do some mathematics, and report their results on Monday.\u201d Can you imagine a young, postdoc woman mathematician saying to a male colleague, maybe senior to her, \u201cHey let\u2019s rent a sailboat this weekend, have fun, and do some mathematics?\u201d Women have been excluded from the kind of social\/professional activities that men take for granted, that are implicit in their whole lifestyle professionally. It was true then and I think it\u2019s still true today. The idea that mathematics is a solo activity and men don\u2019t talk about it is just not true. It\u2019s often done in social circumstances.   \n  \nRole models, networking, and social\/professional and leadership opportunities are examples of implicit, yet critical, professional advantages available for the majority in a group. If you are in the minority, you have to work to make these explicit for yourself. All the programs I designed, for example Women@SCS at Carnegie Mellon, incorporate explicitly those professional advantages. Right now, at Carnegie Mellon, about 50 percent of undergraduates in computer science are female compared to low double digits elsewhere. And this in the most challenging undergraduate CS program anywhere. So, my feeling is, if it can be done at Carnegie Mellon by just changing the environment and not the curriculum, then it can be done anywhere. I want to stress: we are not saying that women have to do things differently, they just need to have the same opportunities.   \n  \n**Why have things for women not changed more?**   \n  \nWe were doing all those things in the Bay Area in the 70s. I made a film at the time called *The Math\/Science Connection: Educating Young Women for Toda*y. I featured Math for Girls, Expanding Your Horizons, the Mills program and an internship program partnered with IBM and had its premiere at the Pacific Film Archive. A few years ago, I edited the film and now call it [*Back to the Future*](https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/egkpqzxxvj16mwo\/Back\\_to\\_the\\_Future\\_8.mov?dl=0)*.* In truth, I never thought we would be still talking about these issues in 2020.   \n  \nSheila Humphrey was for many years Director of Diversity in EECS. Her leadership and authority made a big difference for women in computer science at Berkeley. I don\u2019t know if there has been anyone comparable in the Berkeley Math Department. I am aware there is some controversy currently in the UC system about \u201cpledges\u201d to support diversity. I\u2019m not sure about pledges, but I am sure that it is important for universities to take diversity seriously enough to do something.   \n  \nAt Carnegie Mellon I was never lucky in getting outside grants to support the Women@SCS program. (At first NSF was skeptical that our simple method would work. Later, they would say we were so far ahead of the curve, and other schools were needier.) But the School of Computer Science realized that amongst the things that it was famous for, and good at, was attracting and retaining women in computer science. So, the program I started became a line item in the dean\u2019s budget including support for the program director (for many years Carol Frieze, who was my graduate student).   \n  \nIt\u2019s important that the university takes that seriously enough to do something. Student groups are great but at best are episodic. Leadership has to come from the administration in every area.   \n  \n6 In those years, you only had to take two years of math in high school to graduate, and young women were often counseled by their parents and school counselors, \u201cWhy spoil your school record with a B or C in math?\u201d whereas boys were counseled to stick with it because you couldn\u2019t become an engineer otherwise.   \n  \nFeatured image: Dr. Lenore Blum at CMU.",

    "markdown":"Consider this scenario: You want to buy something at the store. You hop in your car, and you unlock your phone with Face ID. You tell it ,\u201cHey Google, take me to the nearest Macy\u2019s,\u201d and your phone navigates you to the store. After you pick what you want to buy, you point your phone at the reader. Your phone recognizes the reader and charges your card. This anecdote may seem unremarkable now, but just 10 years ago, none of this was possible. Your phone would not have identified your face, listened to your verbal cues, or used the card reader. All of these capabilities developed during the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in the 2010s, driven by a combination of neural networks, graphics processors, and an abundance of new data.   \n  \n## **Neural Networks Mimic the Human Brain**  \n  \nThe AI revolution began with the rise of a class of AI algorithms known as *neural networks.* These algorithms, when visualized, look and behave a lot like human brains. They are made up of many intricate connections to produce a desired output, similar to the complicated connections between neurons.   \n  \nWhen children are first learning how to read and write, a teacher might ask students to pair vocabulary words with a corresponding picture. In the same way, neural networks must be trained. Imagine we want to create a neural network that classifies images into two groups: has camel and does not have camel. First, we must teach the neural network what a camel looks like through *supervised* learning. We provide the network with a training set of images and explicitly tell the network which images have camels and which do not.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/aiRevolution\\_fig1\\_neuralNetwork\\_vPublish.png) *An illustration of the input, output, and internal workings of a neural network.*   \n  \nAn image is fundamentally a grid of pixels. From the training images, the network learns which pixels form characteristic features of camels, such as the hump. First, it groups together a set of pixels and randomly assigns a *weight* that signifies how important those pixels are. After repeatedly grouping pixels and applying weights, the network can decide if the image has a camel. Based on if it was correct or not, the network tunes its weights accordingly. Over time, it learns to accurately classify images as with or without camels.   \n  \n## **Graphics Processors Enable Efficient Neural Networks**  \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/aiRevolution\\_fig2\\_GPU\\_imageAbundance\\_vPublish.png) *An illustration outlining the differences between CPUs and GPUs, and a graph showing how ImageNet\u2019s size grew over time.*   \n  \nWe know that neural networks function by repeatedly grouping pixels and multiplying them by weights. However, images can have many millions of pixels, and 20th century computer processors would routinely take days to train neural networks on these images.   \n  \nNeural networks were boosted by the introduction of parallel processors in the mid-2000s. While ordinary computer processors grouped and weighted sets of pixels one by one, new parallel processors could apply weights on two to four groups of pixels at a time. However, these processors were also overkill. Parallel processors were designed to run two to four complex tasks in parallel, such as running a web browser or playing a game. In contrast, neural network tasks are simple, requiring basic steps like additions and multiplications.   \n  \nWhat neural networks really needed were graphics processors able to run many simple tasks in parallel. For instance, graphics processors can simultaneously change every pixel in an i\\mage to a different color. In the late 2000s, researchers were able to repurpose graphics processors to run neural networks, shortening the process of training neural networks from days to hours.   \n  \n## **The Internet Provides an Abundance of Data**  \n  \nEven with graphics processors accelerating neural network algorithms, the data needed to train neural networks was hard to come by in the 20th century. The rise of the Internet has made data much more available now. However, just because data is out there does not mean it is easy to retrieve. In the above example, getting thousands of pictures of camels can still be a difficult task. To make this easier, in 2009, Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li and her lab developed the ImageNet database, a repository of millions of images across thousands of categories. This dataset allows AI researchers to collect thousands of images relevant to their needs.   \n  \nProfessor Li also began hosting an annual competition, inviting researchers to write increasingly accurate AI algorithms to classify images in ImageNet. Accuracy rates improved only slightly every year until 2012. Then Alex Krizhevsky, a graduate student at the University of Toronto, submitted a graphics processor-powered neural network to the competition in 2012. It was enormously better than the competitors and the state of the art at the time.   \n  \nA combination of neural networks, graphics processors, and the Internet has powered the most recent AI revolution. However, AI is still nascent, with many open problems. Many are doing important work on reducing bias in AI algorithms. In addition, while supervised learning is popular, researchers are also studying *semi-supervised* learning. Here, instead of labeling all the input data, as is done in supervised learning, only a fraction of the input data is explicitly labeled. Others are developing processors specific to neural networks. From automating disease diagnosis, to discovering new materials, to developing self-driving vehicles, future research in AI will underpin technology in the future.   \n  \n-------   \n  \n*Alok Tripathy is a graduate student in computer science*   \n  \n*Designs by Meghan Turner*",

    "markdown":"Wisconsinite sheep did not have a good year in 2019. Farmers\u2019 losses made the headlines \u2014 \u201c[thirteen sheep] [lost](https:\/\/www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com\/story\/news\/2019\/07\/09\/wood-county-wolf-attack-13-sheep-killed-town-hansen\/1682857001\/) in Wood County,\u201d \u201cdozens of sheep [slaughtered](https:\/\/waow.com\/2019\/05\/15\/sheep-attacked-by-wolves-on-north-central-wisconsin-farm\/) by wolves.\u201d These deaths were most, if not all, of these farmers\u2019 livestock. While the United States Department of Agriculture compensated these farmers for their losses because grey wolves remain covered by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in the state, living next to large carnivores remains a risky, ominous, and oftentimes emotionally draining experience.   \n  \nAshleigh Calaway of the Wisconsin Farm Bureau [writes](https:\/\/www.agdaily.com\/livestock\/wisconsin-farm-family-lives-wolf-attack-nightmare\/), \u201cImagine waking up one morning and everything that you have worked towards for the last 30 years is gone. In a blink of an eye you have lost over 30 years of genetics, 30 years of blood, sweat, and tears. Just to be told that there is nothing you can really do about it except fill out some paperwork and wait for a small reimbursement that won\u2019t equal the true value of the animals you lost. How do you move on? How do you recover?\u201d   \n  \nWisconsin\u2019s farm families are not the only ones struggling with the effects of carnivore-livestock conflict. Over 4.2 billion cows, sheep, goats and pigs graze on 30 percent of the planet's land. As farms and settlements encroach on the native territories of large carnivores, it becomes increasingly obvious that the mutual threat of carnivore-livestock conflict must be further explored.   \n  \nScientists in the Brashares Group in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management (ESPM) at UC Berkeley have recently developed an ecological framework that helps contextualize carnivore-livestock conflict. Their research lies at the intersection of ecological theory, human-wildlife conflict, and conflict management, simultaneously untangling the complexity behind carnivore predation on livestock and providing alternate perspectives that could be helpful in choosing ecologically conscious, nonlethal intervention techniques.   \n  \n\u201cThere is no intervention that works in all contexts for carnivore-livestock conflict,\u201d explains ESPM graduate student Christine Wilkinson, lead author of the recent [study](https:\/\/nature.berkeley.edu\/BrasharesGroup\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/cobi.13469.pdf), \u201cAs a lab, we were trying to outline the ecological components that influence livestock predation by carnivores, and create an ecological framework to be used by researchers and practitioners for effective conflict interventions.\"   \n  \nWilkinson\u2019s team realized early in the process that there was a dearth of literature surrounding the topic. Many existing frameworks addressed socio-political and economic factors that come with carnivore-livestock conflict; there are even established theories about predation and how it applies to wild prey. However, little information exists to tackle the core of the issue: how do the principles of predation apply to domestic prey, and what parameters can help determine the proper intervention techniques?   \n  \n## The Sensitive Issue of Livestock Loss  \n  \nThe experiences surrounding livestock predation are not homogenous. Depending on the community and local culture the perceptions surrounding the loss of livestock to large predators are markedly different. Last year, US Fish and Wildlife celebrated the steadily increasing numbers of grey wolves and proposed returning the management to the states. Wisconsin ranchers and farm families were quick to get on board\u2014removal from the ESA would allow them to intervene in what they consider as more \u201cappropriate methods to protect their livestock,\u201d Calaway writes. Potentially lethal measures against carnivores to protect their animals would be an option once again.   \n  \nDr. Jennifer Miller, senior scientist at Defenders of Wildlife and former postdoctoral researcher with the Brashares Group at UC Berkeley, worked in central India during her doctoral research. Her experiences with livestock predation in rural villages on the buffer area between the forest reserve and the community reveals a similar story to the small livestock farmers in Wisconsin.   \n  \n\u201cIn rural India, cattle are a really important form of sustenance for a farmer. A family there may only own one head of cattle, and it tends to be intricately tied to their lives\u2014for the milk they drink, the milk they might sell, the way they till their farms and their fields\u2014it could even feel like part of the family.\u201d When these families experience the loss of livestock due to large carnivores the repercussions are devastating.   \n  \nThe experience of livestock loss to family farms is a stark contrast to the experience of large ranches in the United States which can have hundreds to thousands of heads. The economic losses may remain proportionately equal, but the situational impacts to the humans who own them couldn\u2019t be more different.   \n  \nDespite the nuances surrounding livestock loss, one thing appears to be constant. Apart from the carnivore-livestock conflict, human-human conflict is tightly intertwined with the problem. In the United States, government involvement in carnivore-livestock issues has been shown to lead to resentment in the community. Similar government interventions in other countries, especially for farmers with few animals, has also been seen as overbearing and inconsistent. Bridging the gap between \u201cbig government\u201d and the livestock owner remains an important policy avenue.   \n  \nWhen all these factors are taken into consideration, livestock predation becomes a multifaceted issue, with economic, ecological, emotional, cultural, political, and social repercussions.   \n  \n## A Framework Which Captures it All  \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Figure-2.png) *Interactions between these three aspects of the framework created by the Brashares Group influence predation events.*   \n  \nThe Brashares Group began their framework by organizing parameters into three major categories: biophysical landscape characteristics, carnivore ecology, and livestock ecology. These factors are interdependent, and understanding them in relation to each other provides a novel perspective toward predation. By looking at various examples, such as geographic topography, livestock behavior, and carnivore distribution, it became evident that an individual driver of conflict could also be influenced by other drivers within and outside of its category.   \n  \n\u201cThere\u2019s a concept in ecology that focuses on the \u2018accessibility\u2019 versus the \u2018availability\u2019 of prey,\u201d Miller explains. \u201cPrey tend to forage in certain parts of the environment. They might go where the grass is thicker\u2014if we\u2019re talking about an antelope, it would want to go where it could get the maximum calories for the time that it spends there\u2014but they might also choose a more open area where they can keep an eye out for predators. It\u2019s going to choose to forage where it has a good habitat, but also where it\u2019s safe from a predator.\u201d   \n  \n\u201cBut a predator won\u2019t be able to attack just anywhere,\u201d Miller continues. \u201cA predator needs a place where it can hunt efficiently. A tiger, for instance, needs to be in a place with thick vegetation, where it can hide before it leaps. So, there are places where a prey may graze such that it is available, but not accessible, to the predator.\u201d   \n  \nThe Brashares Group translated these principles into their framework. Without human intervention, livestock would be inherently accessible. A carnivore could easily attack a lone sheep on a hill. But by the virtue of domestication, this sheep would still choose to graze in a place where it feels safer, despite losing much of its anti-predator defenses. Once humans become managers of the animal, they may choose to alter the biophysical landscape by putting up fences and mowing down trees such that the livestock has more space to graze\u2014and making it more difficult for carnivores to hide. These ideas touch upon various parameters in the model. Where the livestock choose to graze touches both upon the biophysical landscape and livestock ecology. Where predators are located and how they behave falls under carnivore ecology. With these factors in mind, livestock managers and scientists can choose to find intervention techniques that make sense both economically and ecologically.   \n  \n## Intervention Techniques  \n  \nThe United States has a long history of lethal and reactive management of predators to reduce livestock loss\u2014including killing carnivores and using lethal poisons which indirectly affect the environment. But in the last few decades, proactive, non-lethal methods are being used to protect livestock. As a result, many predator populations are becoming more abundant, while imminent conflict lessens in many communities. Not only does this enable a resistant ecosystem, but it creates one in which humans and carnivores can coexist with limited issues.   \n  \nProactive measures against large carnivores include traditional methods like electric fencing and [fladry](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kF01SFFufv0). Ranchers also find new solutions to an age-old problem. A foxlight helps mimic the patterns (and sounds) that a human with a flashlight would make. Inflatable car lot dancers have also been found effective in reducing wolf attacks.   \n  \nMeasures have also been taken regarding the livestock themselves. Guardian dogs have proven effective in reducing the attacks from other canid species, such as coyotes, by simulating another predator. Some livestock managers have gone as far as to move livestock regularly from pastures and to keep them enclosed at night, making it harder for carnivores to hunt them.   \n  \nBut Wilkinson is quick to note that there is not a \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution. \u201cBecause of the cultural, economic, political, and ecological factors that surround livestock predation events, carnivore-livestock conflict is a very context-specific issue. However, at the core of this conflict is an ecological act: predation. The framework we present will help managers across ecological contexts to best choose and target conflict interventions.\"   \n  \nBy clearly delineating what aspects of the framework a group may be dealing with, it becomes clear which parameters are involved in conflict, and which areas are best to target. From there, livestock managers and scientists can work together to brainstorm proactive interventions that positively impact farmers and the predators they share their homes with. The conversation is driven in a different direction \u2014one which focuses on quality solutions and nonlethal management.   \n  \n## The Importance of Cultural Competency  \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Figure-3.png) *As communities encroach on what was once the native territories of large carnivore species, instances of carnivore-livestock predation become increasingly common.*   \n  \nThe emotional aspect of livestock loss varies between cultures and within communities, and often guides the way scientists and governments approach intervention techniques. A framework may work well in theory, but its application to communities around the world requires careful thought and cultural knowledge.   \n  \n\u201cIn India, there\u2019s a deeper awareness that if you graze your livestock on the landscape you are responsible if a tiger or leopard attacks them,\u201d Miller explains. \u201cThe people there talked about it like a tax \u2014a loss that they sometimes give up in exchange for grazing their livestock there and for using nature and the environment for improving their livelihood.\u201d   \n  \nSuch ideas are foreign in the United States. Settlers arrived in the Americas with a clear mission: colonization. Various governments and religious authorities conferred the divine right, also referred to as Manifest Destiny, to conquer and tame the land. This included the domestication of animals, dominating the landscape by removing predators, and eliminating environmental threats that would make their \u201cresponsibility\u201d impossible.   \n  \n\u201cThere\u2019s a deep cultural root which creates these differences,\u201d emphasizes Miller. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of steps in between developing a scientific framework like we have done, and actually seeing it implemented by management. We would never take a framework like this and force it onto a community; rather, it\u2019s a guide for a conversation with them.\u201d   \n  \nWilkinson underscores that the ecological components are only one layer of the framework. \u201cI definitely recommend meaningful discussions with communities who experience carnivore-livestock conflict. Fostering connections and trust between groups dealing with conflict and those doing conservation work is crucial so that people at the very least can feel that they\u2019re being heard. Trust can be just as important for conservation outcomes as tangible ecological interventions.\u201d   \n  \n-------   \n  \n*Samvardhini Sridharan is a graduate student in molecular and cell biology*   \n  \n*Designs by Natalie Goh*",

    "markdown":"As scientists, we\u2019re taught to believe in objectivity; in washing our hands of biases in pursuit of truth. As academics scrambling up an increasingly precarious career ladder, we\u2019re taught to believe in meritocracy; that anyone who tries hard enough can succeed.   \n  \nBut clinging to objectivity, meritocracy, and apoliticism often blinds scientists to the inequities they perpetrate. We are eager to blame anything other than our own community\u2014the \u201c[leaky pipeline\u201d](https:\/\/www.pittwire.pitt.edu\/news\/researchers-addresses-leaky-pipeline-academic-science), \u201c[STEM deserts\u201d](https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/opinion\/knowledge-bank\/articles\/2017-05-10\/the-us-must-address-disparities-in-access-to-stem-education), [low childhood self esteem](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/education\/archive\/2014\/11\/too-many-kids-quit-science-because-they-dont-think-theyre-smart\/382165\/). By shirking responsibility in this way, we imply that prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) must be someone else\u2019s job.   \n  \nIn mid-March 2020, shelter-in-place orders hurled a massive wrench into research programs across UC Berkeley, shutting down research and relegating many scientists to their homes. Just over two months later, with all quarantined eyes online, George Floyd was murdered by a white police officer in Minneapolis. This time, when DEI issues were thrust back into the spotlight, there was nowhere else to turn.   \n  \nThe university rushed to respond, issuing blanket statements of support within days of the murder. This time, it wasn\u2019t enough. Social media movements like [#BlackInTheIvory](https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/BlackInTheIvory?src=hashtag\\_click) and [#ShutDownSTEM](https:\/\/www.shutdownstem.com\/) amplified the stories of Black academics and the anti-Blackness perpetuated by their institutions, waking otherwise-disengaged scientists up to their complacency in systemic racism.   \n  \n\u201cThese last couple months have felt like an infusion of possibility; a widening of a window,\u201d says Regina Eckert, Computer Science (EECS) PhD candidate and co-founder of [Bias Busters](https:\/\/biasbusters.berkeley.edu\/). In response to June\u2019s tidal wave of urgent political mobilization, STEM departments rushed to schedule town halls, assemble task forces, and confront demands set by trainees. In this moment, Eckert adds, \u201cwe can propose radical solutions without being immediately dismissed. Whether or not this bears fruit will be a test of time, but the possibility is here now. It wasn\u2019t four months ago.\u201d   \n  \nIn many ways, this wave of momentum feels unique, but it isn\u2019t the first time grad student activists have pushed UC Berkeley to address DEI issues. Alexa Nicolas, Plant and Microbial Biology (PMB) PhD candidate and [UAW 2865](https:\/\/uaw2865.org\/) head steward (representing UC graduate student instructors), reflects that unfortunately, \u201cit takes the most traumatic events to remind us that equity is important.\u201d   \n  \nIn 2015, Dylann Roof shot nine Black churchgoers in Charleston, triggering a surge of Black Lives Matter demonstrations. UAW 2865 joined activists demanding police reform and called for the [expulsion of police unions](https:\/\/www.dailycal.org\/2015\/08\/02\/uc-student-worker-union-denounces-police-unions\/) from the [AFL-CIO](https:\/\/aflcio.org\/about-us) (American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations). Five summers later, following the killings of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd, the [same demands](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2020\/06\/30\/police-union-ouster-346249) are rising back to the surface.   \n  \n[Last year](https:\/\/www.dailycal.org\/2019\/11\/26\/tech-for-progress-not-for-ice\/), as the Trump administration stripped the rights of migrants and refugees, EECS student activists demanded [#NoTechForICE](https:\/\/notechforice.com\/), pushing the university to suspend Immigration and Customs Enforcement-supporting tech giants from recruiting on campus. Now, following the resurgence of [Black Lives Matter](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2020\/07\/03\/us\/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html), students are [reviving their demands](https:\/\/www.dailycal.org\/2020\/06\/25\/student-activists-push-against-ucs-unsustainable-partnerships\/).   \n  \nPast iterations of organizing around anti-racism and police abolition laid the groundwork for 2020 organizers to hit the ground running. Computer science PhD candidate Hani Gomez clarifies, \u201cWe\u2019re not saying that Berkeley hasn\u2019t done anything. We\u2019re saying that we have to acknowledge that it hasn\u2019t been enough.\u201d   \n  \nSo the unsettling question lingers: why are so many people listening for the first time this summer, when it\u2019s clear the same issues have been raised before?   \n  \n## Why now?  \n  \nWe\u2019re trapped, scared, and desperately seeking a sense of purpose: optimal conditions for Sudden Onset White Guilt transmission. \u201cDuring quarantine, you have no other choice but to pay attention,\u201d says Molecular & Cellular Biology (MCB) PhD candidate and [inclusive](https:\/\/mcb.berkeley.edu\/) [MCB+](https:\/\/mcb.berkeley.edu\/) (iMCB+) co-director Kyle Tucker. \u201cThere was this one-two punch, COVID-19 and George Floyd, that mobilized people.\u201d   \n  \nWhite folks do indeed appear to be [coming out of the woodwork](https:\/\/theundefeated.com\/features\/why-did-black-lives-matter-protests-attract-unprecedented-white-support\/), eager to learn how to become effective allies against racism. Over 50 percent of the PhD students in the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, for example, have joined intradepartmental advocacy groups since early June, and about 85 percent of them identify as non-URM (underrepresented minorities). Hundreds of STEM trainees across the UC system have [signed petitions](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1Olr0O8sfxxQjjtnE1CXHVgzirv3gtTbtq2tSiWUVAzU\/edit) demanding UCPD abolition and departmental policy changes.   \n  \nEmerging activists, while enthusiastic and well-intentioned, often have limited experience and expertise. Tucker cautions, \u201cWhile we\u2019re all really passionate, we\u2019re not all ready.\u201d   \n  \nGina Borgo, Infectious Disease and Immunity PhD candidate, is one of many grad students grappling with this. \u201cI was not very involved in the past,\u201d she admits, \u201cbut current events made it difficult to ignore my personal inaction. As much as I\u2019d like to pretend that these were issues I thought about before, my current involvement is a direct result of George Floyd\u2019s murder.\u201d   \n  \n![A phone, laptop, and coffee mug on a table. The phone screen is filled with hashtags: #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd #JusticeForElijiahMcClain #JusticeForAhmaudArbery #JusticeForJacobBlake. The laptop is open to the news, with the headlines \u201cCOVID-19 Death Rate For Black Americans Twice That For Whites\u201d and \u201cAfrican Americans bear the brunt of COVID-19\u2019s economic impact.\u201d A quote from Kyle Tucker, MCB PhD candidate and iMCB+ co-director, is highlighted: \u201cDuring quarantine, you have no other choice but to pay attention.\u201d ](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/fig1\\_quarantineAttention\\_v2.jpg) *We have no choice but to pay attention.*   \n  \n## The value of DEI labor  \n  \nLike Borgo, many academic researchers don\u2019t focus on DEI work, instead prioritizing what they came to UC Berkeley to do: science. But the work still needs to be done. Unfortunately, when researchers are not incentivized to devote their time, energy, and money towards DEI initiatives, those privileged enough to do so sit out, and the burden falls on the backs of URMs.   \n  \n\u201cOur lived experiences become intellectual material for people to debate,\u201d says Krisha Aghi, Neuroscience PhD candidate. \u201cMany of our white colleagues just get to do their science, while we sit and absorb this trauma into our bodies and into our minds, *on top of* doing science. It burned me out.\u201d   \n  \nFighting for social justice should be an essential role of academic leadership, especially in science, which has been [weaponized against marginalized people](https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/science-nature\/disturbing-resilience-scientific-racism-180972243\/) for hundreds of years. \u201cFaculty become community leaders as soon as they are hired,\u201d says Alexander Alvara, Mechanical Engineering PhD candidate and Latinx student activist. Tucker adds, \u201cFaculty should know that, even if they\u2019re bringing in their own baggage and biases, they\u2019re occupying a position of power.\u201d It then becomes their responsibility, as advisors and administrators, to harness their power to build a better academy.   \n  \nIn addition to issuing statements in support of DEI initiatives, STEM departments need to put their money where their mouths are. Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM) PhD Candidate Lucy Andrews emphasizes that compensating trainees for their labor underscores its value. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea of *donating time* towards making our departments anti-racist and anti-colonial,\u201d she says, \u201cbut that just reproduces inequality. Paying people is a way for departments to emphasize that they value this work.\u201d   \n  \nUndervaluing (while still expecting) free DEI labor backs trainees into a corner. Michelle Reid, MCB PhD candidate and iMCB+ co-director, notes, \u201cthe sentiment has been that when you devote your time to activism, your commitment to science is questioned.\u201d   \n  \nBut June\u2019s protests shifted the [Overton window](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/02\/26\/us\/politics\/overton-window-democrats.html), making space for trainees to step out of their comfort zones, get involved, and have conversations with their advisors that once seemed unimaginable. \u201cWe\u2019ve been actively talking within our departments, and it doesn\u2019t feel like lip service anymore,\u201d says Carlos Biaou, Computer Science PhD candidate and former Black Graduate Engineering and Science Students ([BGESS](https:\/\/callink.berkeley.edu\/organization\/gablackgraduateengineeringandscience)) president. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make the most of this moment before it passes.\u201d   \n  \n## Starting the conversation  \n  \nTo break through to those who would otherwise claim well-intentioned ignorance, scientists must bring these conversations about anti-Blackness and systemic racism into their research spaces. Chrissy Stachl, a Chemistry PhD candidate [writing her dissertation](https:\/\/www.chrissystachl.com\/current-projects\/) on climate assessments in her department, points out, \u201cthe people who are hardest to reach are often those who have never had a reason to confront racism.\u201d   \n  \nIn departments with [abysmally low](https:\/\/diversity.berkeley.edu\/reports-data\/diversity-data-dashboard) numbers of non-white, non-male faculty, those hardest to reach often hold all power to implement policy changes. Since June, \u201cI\u2019ve seen a huge change,\u201d Stachl adds. \u201cIn my wildest dreams, before the George Floyd protests, I never thought these conversations would happen. But they\u2019re the norm now\u2014people who *aren\u2019t* talking about these issues are the minority.\u201d   \n  \nTransparent communication between faculty, staff, and trainees is critical. Ultimately, the power to make lasting institutional change lies with the administration. \u201cIf they\u2019re not part of the solution,\u201d cautions Baiou, \u201cthey\u2019re definitely part of the problem.\u201d   \n  \nStachl has devoted years towards building trust between trainees and advisors in the chemistry department, and has seen [significant improvements](https:\/\/pubs.acs.org\/doi\/10.1021\/acs.jchemed.9b00163) in dedication to DEI efforts since institutionalizing annual community surveys and discussions three years ago. \u201cWe no longer have to *demand* things,\u201d she says, \u201ceven though we ask for a lot.\u201d She also emphasizes that DEI initiatives should come from faculty. \u201cThey should trust their students and listen to their needs, and find ways to move forward without being demanded.\u201d   \n  \nAndrews observed a similarly positive shift in the ESPM department this summer. After receiving a [letter of demands](https:\/\/ourenvironment.berkeley.edu\/sites\/ourenvironment.berkeley.edu\/files\/ESPM\\_Letter\\_to\\_Faculty%20%284%29.pdf) from graduate students, ESPM faculty promptly responded with a [well-thought-out, detailed action plan](https:\/\/ourenvironment.berkeley.edu\/sites\/ourenvironment.berkeley.edu\/files\/ESPM\\_Response\\_letter\\_to\\_students\\_FINAL.pdf). Trainees and advisors are working together to hold each other accountable because, she says, \u201cWe have the relationships and structure available to do so. Our program has a [beautiful history](https:\/\/ourenvironment.berkeley.edu\/about\/history), even if it\u2019s imperfect.\u201d   \n  \nWhile some trainees received rapid, thoughtful, unified responses to their demands, others did not. Some larger, decentralized, or more technical programs were less equipped to address DEI concerns. Why?   \n  \n## Beyond the illusion of apoliticicism  \n  \nLogistics aside, all the action plans and DEI task forces in the world still fail to clear one critical barrier to progress: the illusion of objectivity. Scientists often claim to [rise above politics](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-019-02379-w), but it is clear that [science and politics are intertwined](https:\/\/www.aps.org\/publications\/apsnews\/201605\/politics.cfm), and that politics [strongly influence people\u2019s perceptions of science](https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/science\/2015\/07\/01\/americans-politics-and-science-issues\/).   \n  \nAs Andrews points out, sociopolitical topics tend to be conspicuously excluded from STEM curricula. \u201cI\u2019m always blown away that someone can earn a terminal degree and not have a political understanding to accompany it. Everyone should be able to understand our collective history and our place in this system.\u201d   \n  \nSome STEM graduate programs, such as those housed in the School of Public Health, maintain a baseline degree of political energy because their research, by default, centers subjective human experience. But as Computer Science PhD candidate and Graduates for Engaged and Extended Scholarship in Computing and Engineering ([GEESE](https:\/\/geesegraduates.org\/about\/)) co-founder Sarah Dean points out, this awareness shouldn\u2019t be reserved for those most connected to social sciences. \u201cNone of our work can be entirely devoid of politics,\u201d she says, \u201cno matter how technical.\u201d   \n  \nIn fact, a data-driven mindset can be an asset: in broaching difficult conversations, presenting DEI issues in terms of facts and citing peer-reviewed studies can fill gaps in lived experience. Groups such as [iMCB+](https:\/\/mcb.berkeley.edu\/diversity\/inclusive-mcb) and the [Chemistry Graduate Life Committee](https:\/\/cglc.cchem.berkeley.edu\/) take this approach, and have been committed to evidence-based DEI methods from their inception. By combining quantitative assessments, personal anecdotes, and small group discussion, activists can frame conversations about social justice in science terms, meeting academics where they\u2019re at.   \n  \n![Stacks of books are scattered across a cluttered desk, pushing a beaker and some pipettes off to the back corner. The books all have labels like \u201cDEI\u201d and \u201cAdvocacy.\u201d Two quotes are highlighted. Malak El-Quessny, Neuroscience PhD candidate: \u201cWe came here to do science, and were forced to create boundaries after being completely drained by advocacy work.\u201d Michelle Reid, MCB PhD candidate & iMCB+ co-director: \u201cI should be doing science, but instead, I have to carry this weight so it doesn\u2019t come crashing down on the next generation.\u201d](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/fig2\\_scienceVsAdvocacy\\_v2.png) *Carrying the weight of advocacy at the expense of science*   \n  \n## The minority tax  \n  \nStill, this can be tricky. Academia is characterized by its power imbalances, placing trainees at the mercy of their advisors. While STEM departments proudly (or at least requisitely) display diversity statements on their websites, diversity-related *actions* are rarely sparked from the top down. \u201cAll the pushing is on the trainee side,\u201d observed MCB Postdoctoral Fellow Dr. Flora Rutaganira. \u201cThe only accountability I see on the other side is from URM faculty who have always cared about these issues, and there are very few of them.\u201d   \n  \nIssuing statements of support for diversity initiatives is a good first step, but it will take years of sustained, organized labor to make up for decades of systemic inequity. More often than not, the trainees willing to sacrifice valuable research hours for service are those for whom silence isn\u2019t an option. When advocacy work is framed as *extracurricular*, rather than essential, trainees have to weigh the consequences that joining DEI efforts will have on their research productivity.   \n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s like the cliche: if you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu,\u201d says Reid. \u201cIf you\u2019re not represented, your needs won\u2019t be met. I should be doing science, but instead, I have to carry this weight so it doesn\u2019t come crashing down on the next generation.\u201d   \n  \nThis burden is so familiar to underrepresented academics at all levels, it has a name: [the Minority Tax](https:\/\/imdiversity.com\/diversity-news\/the-minority-tax-an-unseen-plight-of-diversity-in-medical-education\/). When institutions decide to address systemic racism, they automatically turn to those most affected by inequity, dumping additional duties on URMs that take precious time away from scientific research and publication.   \n  \nAs long as academic service is uncompensated and passed over on job applications, institutions will disproportionately reward those privileged enough to keep their heads down while the world burns around them. To level the playing field, we must redistribute the DEI burden. \u201cIt should very much be white folks engaging in these conversations: white faculty and white trainees,\u201d says Gomez. \u201cWe all need to think about how to weave DEI efforts into our everyday lives, because URMs? We have no other choice.\u201d   \n  \n## A double-edged sword  \n  \nPreviously-disengaged people are starting to show up, and the upswell in support is a welcome change for longtime student activists. \u201cI\u2019m happy that people are stepping up to the plate now,\u201d says Christine Liu, Neuroscience PhD candidate and co-founder of [Two Photon Art](http:\/\/twophotonart.com). Neuroscience PhD Candidate Malak El-Quessny adds, \u201cWe came here to do science, and were forced to create boundaries after being completely drained by advocacy work. I\u2019m glad that now, we can finally focus on the work we came here to do.\u201d   \n  \nHowever, many URM activists are justifiably skeptical that this moment will become a lasting movement. Dr. Rutaganira expressed her frustration. \u201cHonestly, I keep thinking, why now? People are *just* realizing that racism exists, and I\u2019m like, yeah! And it has for a long time!\u201d Now, they are seeking education from experts in anti-Blackness in STEM: Black scientists.   \n  \nAllies are finally listening, but it\u2019s a double-edged sword. As barriers to conversations about anti-Blackness are being torn down, Black trainees feel obligated to speak up, even when it requires reliving trauma. \u201cEvery time I miss a meeting,\u201d Tucker (who identifies as Black) says, \u201cI realize that my absence creates a huge hole in people\u2019s understanding.\u201d   \n  \nIt\u2019s draining work, but Black trainees are used to working twice as hard as their colleagues for half the recognition (an experience detailed brilliantly by UC Berkeley Postdoctoral Fellow Dr. Charles D. Brown II in [Physics Today](https:\/\/t.co\/XwLJGPf9YL?amp=1)). \u201cI\u2019ve been a Black person my entire life, and this has always been a tough fight,\u201d says Biaou. \u201cA lot of what we want to accomplish will happen after we\u2019ve left campus. These changes are not for us; they\u2019re for the next generation. We\u2019re not going to benefit directly, but we still owe it to them.\u201d Tucker agrees, \u201cI\u2019m sacrificing myself to make Berkeley better.\u201d   \n  \nSonali Mali, Neuroscience PhD candidate, adds that, even when conversations are led by the most well-intentioned allies, \u201cthey brainstorm all these ideas, but their proposals fail to reflect the lived experiences of URMs.\u201d When Black voices aren\u2019t centered in discussions of anti-Blackness, non-Black voices take over, often perpetuating the very issues they\u2019re trying to address.   \n  \nTraditional tools for gathering student concerns often inadvertently widen the disconnect between what Black trainees need, and the policies non-Black administrators push forward. Anonymous climate surveys, for example, are the go-to channel for trainees to report problems within their research environments. But STEM departments have so few URMs that their concerns fail to break through the sea of lukewarm \u201call\u2019s well\u201d responses from non-URMs. \u201cIt\u2019s an invisible issue,\u201d remarks Dr. Coral Zhou, MCB postdoctoral fellow and co-founder of the nascent MCB Inclusion Leaders. \u201cThere are so few people who are able to speak up for themselves that traditional assessment metrics fail to amplify their specific concerns.\u201d   \n  \n[Research](http:\/\/changingourcampus.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/OVWCampusClimateFactsheet4\\_508-Compliance-Final.pdf) on campus assessment methods suggests that combining qualitative, interview-based data with more quantitative data acquired through research audits, digital storytelling, or anonymous reporting apps. STEM leaders are excellent at designing, carrying out, and interpreting results from scientific experiments. By aiming that passion and expertise towards climate assessments and other DEI benchmarks, administrators may be able to more clearly articulate (and thus, address) how they\u2019ve perpetuated anti-Blackness, and what their most marginalized community members need to succeed.   \n  \n![Four groups of figures stand in clusters, wearing different colors and holding different signs: \u201cMCB DEI,\u201d \u201cEECS DEI,\u201d \u201cChem DEI,\u201d and \u201cPMB DEI.\u201d A quote from Dr. Flora Rutaganira, MCB Postdoc, is highlighted: \u201cIt seems like every department is simultaneously reinventing the wheel.\u201d ](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/fig3\\_reinventingTheWheel\\_animatedGIF.gif) *Each department seems to have individual DEI groups.*   \n  \n## Fanning the flames  \n  \n![One large crowd of figures intermingles, with a central figure holding a single large sign: \u201cDEI.\u201d A quote from Alexander Alvara, Mechanical Engineering PhD candidate, is highlighted: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be the fire-starter.

    "markdown":"***Part I in our COVID-19 series, Swabs and Spit. We take an inside look into how Berkeley scientists have set the bar for COVID-19 testing as the campus community heads back to work.***   \n  \nAs biologists, most of our days are spent toiling in a tucked-away lab prying at core questions important to biology, such as: How do cells regulate their size? How do organisms respond to pathogens? Why do we age? To answer these questions, we have mastered molecular techniques such as PCR, a way to amplify small amounts of DNA in our samples and feed our curiosities by becoming experts about specific cellular pathways and model organisms.   \n  \nRarely are we called upon to apply this expertise to solve a tangible, widespread problem with immediate implications for all of humanity.   \n  \n## The Need for Testing  \n  \nIn early spring, scientists at UC Berkeley started hearing that call. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted a unique challenge that was emerging all around the world. We needed to increase testing efforts, and fast, but the authorizations to do so are typically long and arduous and certainly not practical for a situation which required a rapid response. Despite these challenges, a team of Berkeley scientists, led by Jennifer Doudna, Fyodor Urnov and Dirk Hockemeyer, implemented a so-called \u201dpop-up\u201d testing lab in just three weeks. In tandem, the [Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI)](https:\/\/innovativegenomics.org\/about-us\/) also created a platform to provide the campus community with asymptomatic testing\u2014an absolutely necessary service as we return to work and school. I am humbled to be a part of this volunteer team, made of friends and colleagues from various departments, who have come together in the face of uncertainty and what sometimes feels, frankly, like a chaotic world. I am happy to write a series of posts that will cover the immense efforts involved in this undertaking and, hopefully, emphasize the true team endeavor this has been in bringing testing to campus and the surrounding Bay Area community.   \n  \nThe need for widespread testing became obvious in early- to mid-March, as the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. The infectious disease, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was spreading rapidly around the globe. Just days after the pandemic declaration, Berkeley scientists at the IGI decided to create a pop-up testing lab on campus to meet this need. This effort has been led by IGI Founder and Board President Doudna, who is a world-renowned scientist most notably famous for her pioneering work in CRISPR-based genome editing technologies. The effort is co-lead by Urnov, IGI\u2019s Scientific Director of Technology and Translation, who also has an impressive career pushing the boundaries of genome-engineering technologies and Hockemeyer, associate professor of Cell and Developmental Biology, whose research has paved the way for genome-editing in stem cells. The decision to create a diagnostic testing lab has not only required these three talented scientists, but also the incredible efforts of over 50 students, post-doctoral researchers, and professors, all of whom are volunteering their time.   \n  \n## The Hurdles of Setting up a Clinical Lab  \n  \nThe decision to start testing was a no-brainer to the IGI team; though there were many hurdles to become certified for clinical testing. This process typically involves applying for a state license as well as a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification, which alone can take up to six weeks to be approved. On top of this, all personnel in the lab need to have a clinical lab scientist (CLS) license, which involves a one-year full-time internship and passing a comprehensive written exam. So how was this possible? How could UC Berkeley scientists set up a clinical testing lab in just three weeks?   \n  \nFor starters, some of these regulatory requirements were relaxed in the face of the emergency pandemic situation. This allowed the team of scientists to extend a CLIA certification that already existed on campus\u2014at the University Health Services, Tang Center\u2014to temporarily include a pop-up testing facility at the IGI. Additionally, although the IGI testing facility is managed by a formally trained and certified clinical lab scientist, Lisa Martell, an [executive order signed by Governor Gavin Newson](https:\/\/www.gov.ca.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/3.12.20-EO-N-25-20-COVID-19.pdf) allowed our testing pipeline to be carried out by academic scientists. These scientists must be trained within the rigorous landscape of diagnostic laboratory regulations which include virtual training sessions to comply with EH&S and HIPAA. All of this has allowed volunteers including myself and many other graduate students and postdocs to work in the testing facility handling patient samples.   \n  \nOne major challenge at the forefront of creating a SARS-CoV-2 testing facility centered around the need for a reliable testing protocol that could be authorized by the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). In mid-March, this challenge became even more difficult with extensive personal protective equipment and [reagent shortages reported across the country](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/03\/11\/health\/coronavirus-testing-shortages.html). These problems were solved, in part, by adapting a COVID-19 test that already had an approved EUA protocol from the FDA. This test involves using pipetting robots, operated by volunteer scientists, to extract genetic material from a sample and amplify genes specific to SARS-CoV-2 virus that may be present in the sample. Detection of viral genes below an amplification threshold would indicate viral presence within that sample. This PCR-based test, marketed by Thermo Fisher Scientific, was a perfect fit not only because of its compatibility with the semi-automated robotics system being set up in the lab, but also because of reagent availability and promising results gathered from pilot experiments. Since several adaptations were made to the protocol in order to make this test more high-throughput and cost effective, the IGI testing facility team were required to apply for a new EUA. For more information on the specifics of the IGI\u2019s process, check out the [published blueprint for a pop-up SARS-CoV-2 testing lab](https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41587-020-0583-3).   \n  \nAnother essential piece of the puzzle was implementing a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMs), to securely track patient samples from the clinic, through the lab, and report results. This was established through a collaboration with three cloud-based software companies: ThirdWave Analytics (TWA), Salesforce, and Mulesoft. TWA responded to an urgent call to build a fully custom system and HIPAA-compliant physician requisitioning portal, with Salesforce licensing support. Mulesoft then offered free services to integrate the system with the California Public Health Department\u2019s reporting infrastructure to enable the fast and automated reporting necessary to track and respond to the pandemic at a state level. This system, built in a matter of weeks, would normally take months to build and was essential in allowing secure clinical testing to start at the IGI on April 6th, just over three weeks after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/IGI\\_P1\\_FINAL\\_Phil\\_edits.png) ***Timeline for SARS-CoV-2 pop-up testing lab.** Within one week of the pandemic declaration, Berkeley scientists decided to create a pop-up testing lab on campus. With help from Salesforce, headquartered in San Francisco, the laboratory was set up and took its first samples three weeks after the initial idea.*   \n  \n## The Testing Pipeline  \n  \nWhen I first joined as a volunteer, I was fascinated to learn about how streamlined the whole testing process was. Patient samples arrive from the clinic, go through the testing pipeline, and the results are reported back to the patient in as short as a day or two. While this whole process is securely tracked through the LIMs set up in the testing facility, there are many other parts that go into testing clinical samples. The process generally starts at a clinical partner site where a sample is taken from a patient with a medical equivalent of a long q-tip used to swab the back of the nose and throat. This sample swab immediately goes in a tube with media to inactivate any virus and preserve the integrity of the viral RNA that may be present. The tube containing the sample is then placed in a biohazard bag and brought to the IGI testing facility. There, it encounters the first batch of volunteers at the testing facility\u2014the intake team. Intake involves verifying patient health information, effectively checking to make sure the tube submitted matches the patient it came from, sanitizing the tube in a biosafety hood, and data entry of the sample into the LIMs, allowing the team to track the sample through the testing facility from intake to testing result. This particular process took some time to troubleshoot and perfect; before integration into the LIMs system, intake took much longer. \u201cOn week two, it took nearly 4.5 hours to process 110 samples\u201d, recounts Liz O\u2019Brien, a lead postdoc volunteer on the intake team. \u201cNow we can do close to 500 samples in three hours!\u201d   \n  \nThe samples are then uncapped, with the help of more volunteers, and loaded into a robot that arrays them into a 96-well plate, all while keeping track of which well contained each individual sample. Next, the genetic material from each sample is extracted and used in a PCR reaction to amplify and detect viral genes. If two out of three viral genes are detected, the system recognizes and reports this test as a clinical positive, notifying the clinician. For the rest, where viral genes are not detected in the sample, it is a clinically negative test and the clinician is notified. Currently, the lab\u2019s capacity is around 1,000 tests per day, with a turnaround time of 48 hours, which is much faster than other testing centers statewide where patients might wait four to five days before receiving their results.   \n  \nBuilding this pipeline has been filled with challenges that the team must overcome. Although the lab has been up and running for over four months, these challenges still arise and need to be solved. For example, before the protocol was approved for the use of the pipetting robots, the process of extracting genetic material and running the PCR reaction was done manually. Since approval of the protocol, all of the testing has been semi-automated with robots. While this innovation allows a huge increase in sample capacity, it leaves the lab heavily dependent on the robots working properly. From time to time, they fail, and the lab is on the clock to identify and fix the problem. When this happens, samples are still coming in. The longer it takes to fix the problem, the larger the sample backlog becomes.   \n  \n## It Takes a Village  \n  \nIf that sounds like a lot of work, with an endless number of hurdles, that\u2019s because it was! The IGI team took this in stride though and, in just three weeks, the idea of this pop-up lab became a reality when the testing lab received their first samples from the clinic. To date, their efforts in creating a clinical testing laboratory have helped clinicians across the Bay Area administer and report the results of around 30,000 tests, many of which have been for particularly at-risk communities such as the homeless and elderly populations. Equally impressive is the number of volunteers that have stepped up and come together to make this all possible. The efforts of over 50 people, both volunteer and full-time employees, have carried this from an idea to a reality. People like Shana McDevitt, director of the UC Berkeley genomics sequencing core, have put their \u201cnormal\u201d roles on hold, working around the clock, quite literally, to get the testing facility off the ground and keep it running smoothly. She likens this effort to that of, \u201can army working seven days a week, 10 to 12 hours a day\u201d. What\u2019s that old adage? Oh, yes! It takes a village to start a pop-up clinical testing lab.   \n  \n*This blog post is just the first of a series of three outlining the efforts of a campus-wide initiative to increase testing capacity to keep our community safe. Keep an eye out for Part II, which will cover how volunteers built a \u201csaliva kiosk\u201d for the rapid testing of students, faculty and staff on campus.*   \n  \n-------   \n  \n*Phillip Frankino is a graduate student in molecular and cell biology*   \n  \n*Designs by Santiago Yori*",

    "markdown":"***Part II in our COVID-19 series, Swabs and Spit. We take an inside look into how Berkeley scientists have set the bar for COVID-19 testing as the campus community heads back to work.***   \n  \nSince mid-March, schools and workplaces have shut their doors to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. As states progress through individual reopening plans, more and more people are returning to work and school. Here at Berkeley, as students, faculty, and staff return to resume on-campus research, we also face an increased risk of outbreaks. How do we ensure the health and safety of employees and students who are returning to work in the middle of a global pandemic?   \n  \n## IGI FAST: A Free Asymptomatic Saliva Test for Campus  \n  \nOne main concern that we face across the globe comes from the increasing reports of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread of the virus. Members of the IGI testing team sprang into action once again when realizing that they may be able to mitigate spread by solving another unmet need on campus\u2014asymptomatic testing. Through a newly developed study on campus, [the IGI \u201cFAST\u201d (**F**requent **AS**ymptomatic **T**esting) study](https:\/\/igi-fast.berkeley.edu\/about), researchers hoped to investigate the efficacy of asymptomatic testing on campus as a preventative measure to minimize the spread of COVID-19. The IGI FAST study has been led by IGI founder and recently minted Nobel Laureate, Jennifer Doudna, with clinical support from Assistant Vice Chancellor, Guy Nicolette, of University Health Services. Graduate Student Alex Ehrenberg, of the Integrative Biology Department, has been working alongside the principal investigators as study coordinator.   \n  \nIn this study, asymptomatic employees, students, and staff have been provided with free COVID-19 testing. And what\u2019s even better is that this test doesn\u2019t involve the large medical q-tip going up your nose! The concept is simple: the IGI FAST study uses easy-to-collect saliva samples from participants who visit an on-campus kiosk every two weeks. The samples are then taken back to the IGI testing facility where, using the same PCR-based test performed on the [swab based tests](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/2020\/09\/swabs-and-spit-part-i\/), they are tested for viral SARS-COV-2 genes. This effort was largely driven by student and postdoc volunteers, highlighting the group effort to provide surveillance testing to our campus community. To date, the study has enrolled over 4,800 participants and will have completed over 11,000 tests by the end of the study, scheduled to wrap up on October, 29th. Don\u2019t worry, though! You can still get free asymptomatic testing through the [eTang portal](https:\/\/etang.berkeley.edu) if you are a student, faculty, or staff member on campus!   \n  \n## The Hurdles of a Human Study  \n  \nThe effort to bring free widespread asymptomatic testing to campus hasn\u2019t been an easy one. To get approved for a study involving human participants, Alex first wrote a protocol that would be reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), an FDA-approved committee that exists to ensure the welfare and rights of human subjects. While still in the planning stages and waiting for the protocol to be approved, a collective effort from volunteers of students, staff, and postdocs commenced troubleshooting on-site logistics. At the forefront of these efforts was an incoming freshman, Andy Cate, with an impressive background in software development. He immediately recognized the need for a platform to enroll participants and handle scheduling in a way that could be integrated into the existing databases that the IGI uses for clinical testing. Andy rapidly developed a prototype of the web app and was able to be on-site while test runs of the kiosk were being conducted, which was integral to making these trials a success. \u201cEveryone on our team is extremely talented and hardworking,\u201d says Andy, \u201cand it has been a great experience working with them. I know that our work will have a big impact on the campus, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important to me.\u201d   \n  \nIn addition to the challenge of on-site logistics, the pop up COVID testing facility, on campus at the IGI, was also actively involved with research and development of the saliva test. While collecting saliva in a tube and performing a PCR based test sounds simple to molecular biologists, the task is actually not simple at all! \u201cOn one hand, we want people to have access to advances as soon as possible due to the urgency of the pandemic\u201d, said Neuroscience Graduate Student Holly Gildea, who is involved with the research and development of the test. \u201cOn the other hand, we have to be incredibly confident in what we\u2019re reporting, which requires an extra level of scrutiny.\u201d Holly, along with other volunteers, has been working diligently to troubleshoot the protocols for saliva testing. They set a goal to maintain test sensitivity and detection despite the wide range of saliva properties, like viscosity, that can vary from person to person.   \n  \n## Through the Eyes of a Participant  \n  \nI can tell you, first hand, that all of the saliva kiosk staff have been hard-working and determined to accomplish their goal of increasing the availability of accurate testing. The IGI FAST study has involved an extraordinarily dedicated team of over 80 students, staff, and postdocs, which makes the process of free saliva testing so effortless and simple! To get started, participants would enroll online and, after filling out a few questions and giving informed consent, make an appointment to come to one of two saliva kiosks, located at the Genetics and Plant Biology building (GPBB) and Latimer Hall. Each participant is provided with a unique QR code for their visit. Once arrived, there are four checkpoints to navigate through. The first checkpoint verifies the participant\u2019s appointment for that day and verbally confirms their asymptomatic status. The participant then walks up to the registration checkpoint where they scan their QR code and confirm their name. Saliva kiosk volunteers then make a new requisition in the system for a saliva test, providing the participant with a barcoded sample tube that is electronically attached to their name in the system. Proceeding to the third checkpoint, the spit station, each participant is met with a \u201cspit coach\u201d that gives clear instruction on how to give a saliva sample. Each saliva collection tube is equipped with a clean funnel on the top of the tube, which makes spitting into it quite easy. The participant is asked to fill the tube to a clearly labeled \u201cfill line.\u201d Once the participant gives an adequate saliva sample, they sanitize their tube and head to check-out. Here, they scan their tube and verify their name and date of birth. This ensures that each participant submits a tube that correctly corresponds to their identity. After this verification, they place their tube in a rack and go on with their day. All in all, this process usually takes just five to 10 minutes. At the end of the day, hundreds of these saliva samples are taken to the IGI testing facility, extracted, and tested.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Infographic-600ppi\\_v3.png) *A walk through of the saliva kiosk. Participants progress through four checkpoints to check-in, register and grab their sample tube, give their sample and check-out. Designed for efficiency, all of this takes place in under 10 minutes.*   \n  \n## Volunteers Coming Together to Make a Difference  \n  \nTo make this process a smooth one, and to ensure the safety of our campus community, countless hours have been put in by volunteers. One of those volunteers, Alexandra Tsitsiklis, who recently graduated with a PhD in Immunity and Infectious Diseases, reflected on the incredibly difficult task that is bringing students and staff back to campus. \u201cIt is so important that we do it safely and protect our more vulnerable friends and coworkers, as well as prevent outbreaks that could spread to the community.\u201d Alexandra believes the FAST study \u201cwill help us develop an effective way to identify and contain the inevitable cases on campus.\u201d She continues with the hope that similar efforts will be enacted for other colleges. \u201cTesting saliva is a fast and simple alternative to nasal swabs that doesn\u2019t require medical professionals and lots of PPE,\u201d she says. Alexandra has been involved with the saliva testing efforts from the very beginning. Without her, things would not have progressed so smoothly. \u201cI was excited to help out in the initial stages of the IGI FAST study\u2014figuring out what works best for the setup of the saliva testing site and troubleshooting the saliva collection process to ensure that we get good samples from participants. We are still constantly learning and improving the process as we go.\u201d   \n  \nAs a volunteer myself, I have been warmed to discover the camaraderie and willingness to work toward the unified goal of providing free widespread testing to the campus community. With leadership from volunteers like Erica Moehle, a diagnostic site coordinator who has been integral in the saliva testing efforts, the sky's the limit. Erica has attributed the success of the saliva kiosk to the immense efforts of volunteers, both on site and at the testing facility. \u201cIt has been a huge effort to get this to happen, and it couldn't have happened without all the people who decided they wanted to make a difference.\u201d The FAST study has benefitted from the work of countless volunteers and paid staff, many of whom are not named here for the sake of brevity.   \n  \n## Future Outlook: More Testing  \n  \nEven with these initial successes, however, the fight against COVID-19 is not over. When asked about the challenges our campus community faces this fall as some students return, Erica cited a recent increase in cases on campus. \u201cOver the summer, our campus has been a relatively secluded population, with positivity rates at or below 1 percent\u201d. She commented that the [recent increase](https:\/\/calparents.berkeley.edu\/increase-in-confirmed-covid-19-cases-on-our-campus\/) in cases, confirmed by University Health Services, is an example of how the campus is a microcosm of the pandemic. \u201cWe were prepared for this, with steady increases in testing capacity over the summer, but it underscores the need for vigilance and responsible behavior.\u201d To keep up with the increasing number of students on campus, and to streamline the campus testing efforts, most asymptomatic testing on campus will switch over from saliva to self nasal swabs and the IGI FAST study will finish at the end of October. While the saliva test has been a convenient way to increase campus participation and help keep everybody safe, it is no longer the only asymptomatic testing option on campus. Additionally, even though the saliva test has been clinically validated, traditionally swab samples still work the best with the testing pipeline set up in the IGI pop-up testing lab. Under the direction of Carolyn Sherry, IGI FAST kiosk project manager, limited saliva testing will still happen with small populations of the campus community, including campus Greek life, who will try out a new take-home saliva kit. This will allow campus to continue widespread asymptomatic testing while working hard to continuously optimize the testing platforms we have.   \n  \nIf you want to get tested, it is currently free for all students, faculty and staff! Check out the [University Health Services website dedicated to COVID-19](https:\/\/uhs.berkeley.edu\/coronavirus\/testing-covid-19) for more information about how to get started.   \n  \n*This blog post is the second of a series of three outlining the efforts of a campus-wide initiative to increase testing capacity to keep our community safe. Keep an eye out for Part III, which will provide an updated look into how asymptomatic testing continues to evolve in the middle of this global pandemic.*   \n  \n-------   \n  \n*Phillip Frankino is a graduate student in molecular and cell biology*   \n  \n*Designs by Natalie Goh*",

    "markdown":"To handle surges of COVID-19 patients, hospitals must have enough medical supplies. But anticipating which hospitals will need more supplies is like trying to predict the future.   \n  \nProfessor [Bin Yu\u2019s research group](https:\/\/binyu.stat.berkeley.edu\/) in the Departments of Statistics and Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences is designing effective ways to predict which counties are going to have a surge of COVID-19 patients. The group has designed an ensemble of predictors known as the Combined Linear and Exponential Predictor (CLEP), to forecast COVID-19 deaths per county two weeks into the future.[![Response4Life helps predict demand for PPE in counties experiencing COVID case increases](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/R4L\\_1.png)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/ppe-to-the-ppeople-2\/r4l\\_1\/)   \n  \nCLEP looks at whether COVID-19 deaths are increasing exponentially or linearly. According to the Yu Group, they used predictors for both exponential growth and linear growth, since they each approximate growth patterns at different phases of the pandemic. For some counties, such as New York county in March, COVID-19 deaths were increasing exponentially. However, as the outbreak slowed down, most counties\u2019 COVID-19 deaths slowed to linear growth. CLEP adjusts its prediction based on which type of growth better fits the data. For instance, if the linear predictor performs better on new COVID-19 data, CLEP will give it more weight over the exponential predictor. Having CLEP update itself dynamically allows the Yu Group to have flexible predictions in the midst of an incredibly erratic pandemic.   \n  \nUsing their county-level COVID-19 predictors, the group has also developed a method to predict the hardest-hit hospitals. Based on their [findings](http:\/\/covidseverity.com\/), the group advises Response4Life, a medical supply nonprofit, on which hospitals to prioritize when shipping supplies.",

For rocket scientists, using 9.8 meters per second squared as the value of gravity might be good enough, but the exact value depends on the earth beneath you. For example, a feather drops minutely slower on a mountain than at sea level. The M\u00fcller group detects these tiny deviations in gravity by studying the interference pattern of carefully dropped atoms.   \n  \nTo visualize interference, consider two rocks dropped in a pond forming ripples. The ripples spread and eventually cross paths. After they meet, a snapshot reveals just a single pattern across the pond, blending the previously separate waves. By carefully studying the interference pattern, one can infer where the rocks splashed. Atom interferometry exploits the wave nature of atoms to precisely infer the strength of gravity\u2019s pull on them.   \n  \nThe M\u00fcller lab\u2019s latest breakthrough is their [portable gravimeter](https:\/\/advances.sciencemag.org\/content\/5\/9\/eaax0800), an interferometer that measures gravity on the go. They measured gravity in a U-Haul truck driven around the Berkeley hills, and used the measurements to probe the density of rocks below the ground. By freeing the gravimeter from the fragile, expensive environment of traditional laboratories, the M\u00fcller lab has enabled a new generation of scientific applications.

    "markdown":"[Jesse Gelsinger](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1999\/11\/28\/magazine\/the-biotech-death-of-jesse-gelsinger.html) died in November 1999 after receiving experimental treatment for orthinine transcarbamylase deficiency, an obscure disease which prevents the breakdown of metabolic waste products. His death heralded a monumental shift in the aspirations and hopes of researchers and physicians around the world. Just days earlier, gene therapy\u2014modifying the DNA of a patient\u2014was hyped as a miraculous cure for several seemingly incurable and deadly diseases, ranging from Huntington\u2019s to cancer. However, the field was abruptly quieted following the highly publicized deaths of several patients enrolled in gene therapy clinical trials, including Gelsinger.   \n  \nGelsinger\u2019s death wasn\u2019t caused by the artificial gene injected into his body, but instead by a fatal allergic reaction to the type of virus, known as lentivirus, that was used to carry the gene from the injection site into his cells. Appropriate delivery of DNA cargo through a carrier ship that navigates to the correct destination has been regarded as one of the largest obstacles for gene therapy. Nowadays, thanks to decades of innovations, scientists are finally successfully changing mutated genes in sick patients and generating treatments to countless heritable diseases.   \n  \n## **What is gene therapy?**  \n  \nGene therapy introduces new genetic material into a patient\u2019s DNA to cure disease. DNA contains instructions to create proteins that perform essential functions in the body, and genetic diseases are caused by mistakes or errors in the DNA that lead to missing or dysfunctional proteins. As early researchers discovered this connection, they hoped to create artificial genes or DNA that encoded the dysfunctional protein correctly. Once the artificial DNA was delivered into patients\u2019 cells, the cells would have the correct manual for making the appropriate protein.   \n  \nYet gene replacement therapy was not without its technical hurdles. Integrating an extra gene into patient DNA, where it was not originally intended to fit, often had unexpected consequences on the surrounding DNA, depending on the size of the artificial gene. In some cases, adjacent genes, or even the integrated gene itself, would suddenly generate more or less proteins than expected. The situation was akin to a young adult who invited their family to live with them. The upheaval in their lifestyle might be minimal if only a single sibling arrived, but would likely increase as more of their extended family decided to move in.   \n  \nHowever, in 2012, UC Berkeley chemistry and molecular & cell biology professor Jennifer Doudna found a way to modify DNA that circumvented this obstacle, [earning her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020](https:\/\/www.nobelprize.org\/prizes\/chemistry\/2020\/summary\/). She used a new technique called [CRISPR\/Cas9 genome editing](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2014\/10\/13\/354934248\/in-hopes-of-fixing-faulty-genes-one-scientist-starts-with-the-basics\/). Cas9 is a protein originally discovered in bacteria that can find a specific DNA sequence and cut it, allowing researchers to more easily delete or edit a specific gene. Cas9 is so specific because it relies on a fragment of RNA, a closely related, single-stranded cousin to double-stranded DNA. This fragment of RNA is aptly named a guide RNA, because it guides Cas9 to its cut site by matching and intertwining itself with a complementary piece of DNA targeted for editing. By making precise edits straight into a mutated gene, researchers avoid introducing an entire new copy of the gene.   \n  \nWhether or not doctors use conventional or CRISPR\/Cas9-based methods to treat genetic illnesses in the future, all the materials for treatment must be delivered to the correct cells within a patient. The [Innovative Genomic Institute (IGI)](https:\/\/innovativegenomics.org\/), a partnership between UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco aiming to cure disease using gene therapy, has pioneered several solutions to this problem. In particular, researchers affiliated with IGI have made strides by approaching the delivery of gene therapy in two distinct ways: *ex vivo* and *in vivo*.   \n  \n## **Curing sickle cell anemia using *ex vivo* gene therapy**  \n  \nIn late 2019, [Victoria Gray](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2019\/12\/25\/784395525\/a-young-mississippi-womans-journey-through-a-pioneering-gene-editing-experiment) became the first human to be [successfully treated using CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated gene therapy](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2019\/11\/19\/780510277\/gene-edited-supercells-make-progress-in-fight-against-sickle-cell-disease). She suffered from a devastating disorder predominantly affecting those of African descent called sickle cell anemia. Her success story was built on the foundation of years of academic research, particularly a 2016 study from former IGI and UC Berkeley Professor Jacob Corn\u2019s lab. They reported on how to cure mice of sickle cell anemia using an *ex vivo* gene therapy strategy, which relies on removing diseased cells from a patient, treating them outside their body, and then reintroducing the treated cells back into the patient. This same *ex vivo* strategy was ultimately used to cure Gray.   \n  \nIGI scientific director and UC Berkeley Molecular & Cell Biology Professor Fyodor Urnov describes the first major motivation for targeting sickle cell anemia: opportunity. \u201cWhen a publicly held company approaches a situation like this, they need to understand how will this be profitable, so you need some number of people,\u201d Urnov explains. \u201cSickle has 100,000 people [in the United States].\u201d As a comparison, around 80,000 people are diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in the United States each year. Urnov continues, \u201cThe life expectancy is 40-42 [years], so the unmet medical need is reasonably high.\u201d   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/GeneTherapy\\_1-8.png) *The membrane of a cell acts as a barrier blocking the entry of most particles. Application of an electric field creates 'holes' in the membrane. These holes are large enough to allow gene editing components (i.e. CRISPR\/Cas9) to easily cross the membrane barrier.*   \n  \nAnother huge appeal is that sickle cell anemia is especially amenable to *ex vivo* delivery. Sickle cell anemia is a blood disorder that transforms healthy blood cells into sickle moon-shaped cells that clog arteries and cannot deliver as much oxygen throughout the body. Researchers are able to siphon and collect the sickened blood cells from the body. Then, they can treat the cells by zapping them with an electric shock. The shock causes the cells to open temporary holes in their cell walls, allowing the CRISPR\/Cas9 reagents to move inside and perform the appropriate edits. Scientists observe which of the cells had their DNA correctly edited by Cas9 and transfer only those corrected blood cells back into the patient where they can now function correctly.   \n  \nThe idea of removing cells from a patient, treating them while they sit in a petri dish in a lab, and then returning them back into the patient\u2014*ex vivo* delivery\u2014contrasts with *in vivo* delivery, where DNA is transferred into cells while they remain in the patient\u2019s body. \u201cIn practical terms, *ex vivo* editing is easier than *in vivo*,*\u201d* Urnov says. Since cells are treated outside the body during *ex vivo* gene therapy, researchers can check that the cells are properly corrected and functioning appropriately before returning them to the patient. Additionally*, in vivo* delivery requires the gene therapy reagents to successfully travel through multiple organ systems in the human body before arriving at the correct tissues. When delivering gene therapy reagents to cells in a petri dish, the chances of successful delivery are much higher.   \n  \nDespite its advantages, *ex vivo* delivery restricts treatment to very few diseases. Doctors can remove unhealthy blood cells and then inject corrected blood cells into a patient, but they cannot so easily cut away a piece of a patient\u2019s damaged brain and replace it with new brain cells. As a result, researchers must pivot to *in vivo* gene therapy to cure most genetic illness.   \n  \n## **Changing the destination in *in vivo* gene therapy**  \n  \nAlthough numerous viral-mediated gene therapy clinical trials failed throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, including the lentivirus that killed Gelsinger, researchers have continued to hijack viruses to deliver gene therapies. They push forward despite the historical failures because viruses have mastered the art of injecting foreign DNA into human cells. In fact, around eight percent of the human genome is estimated to be made of sequences that originated from viruses. The most promising viral carrier is the adeno-associated virus (AAV), a small, naturally occurring virus that infects humans and other primate species but is not currently known to cause disease.   \n  \nIGI and UC Berkeley Professor of Bioengineering Dave Schaffer\u2019s lab specializes in developing novel AAVs to target specific organs in the body. Viruses that are better at traveling to particular tissues both increase the chance a tissue\u2019s diseased DNA will be changed and reduce the chance of any sort of catastrophic allergic reaction. Although these viruses exist in nature, most natural AAVs don\u2019t target specific organs. Schaffer explains, \u201cthe field has been compensating for that by really amping up the [viral] dose, and still a tiny fraction of the natural AAV makes it to the right tissue. As a result of the increased dosage, however, the AAV rises above the immune system\u2019s radar, which can lead to toxicity.\u201d By developing more efficient AAVs, doctors can lower the dosage of virus delivered into the human tissue to avoid detection by the immune system and decrease the chance of a negative reaction.   \n  \nThe key to changing AAVs lies in their structure. The AAV consists of a shell, called a capsid, which contains DNA. Each of the twelve viruses, AAV1-12, that naturally infect primates has a unique capsid. Normally, the viral DNA contains instructions on how to replicate the capsid so that when it is injected into a cell, the cell is able to make more viral particles. In the case of gene therapy, the AAV DNA is replaced with instructions on how to make the dysfunctional or missing protein that is causing the disease.   \n  \nWhile DNA is a critical component of gene therapy, the capsid is what most interests the Schaffer lab because its composition dictates the AAV\u2019s cellular target. Changes to the capsid surface increase the ability of viruses to find specific cell types, thus dictating where the AAV goes, how efficiently it travels, and the probability that it will cause an unintended allergic response.   \n  \nThe concept of altering the viral capsid\u2019s structure to control its delivery in the body started in the 1990s. But despite the immense potential of capsid engineering, scientists were unable to figure out how to develop new AAVs that would only travel to specific tissue types. Researchers would redesign specific parts of the AAV capsid based on their understanding of virus biology to change where it traveled, a technique called rational design or engineering. However, the capsid was so complex that researchers were unable to use rational design to successfully determine all the changes they should make. They would inevitably steal away any ability of the virus to deliver gene editing components.[![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/GeneTherapy\\_2-8.png)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/first-cas-gene-delivery\/genetherapy\\_2-8\/)  \n  \nInstead, Schaffer decided to use a different strategy to re-engineer the AAV: directed evolution. Directed evolution was developed by UC Berkeley alum Frances Arnold, who was [awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018](https:\/\/www.nobelprize.org\/prizes\/chemistry\/2018\/arnold\/facts\/) for pioneering the use of this technique to engineer enzymes. The strategy of directed evolution emulates natural evolution by creating a large pool of randomly mutated genes before selecting the genes that best survive a particular task. This process is repeated several times by mutating the winner gene from the selection process into a new, diverse pool. Since directed evolution is performed in a controlled lab, results occur more quickly than they do in nature, where creatures evolve over millions of years. \u201cI began to apply directed evolution towards viruses like AAV for gene therapy applications in 1999, and it\u2019s one of those ideas that ended up working even better than I had hoped,\u201d Schaffer says. Specifically, his lab would randomly mutate\u2014or perform random mutagenesis on\u2014the capsids of AAVs and then track which AAVs traveled to the tissue where researchers wanted to deliver their therapy.  \n  \nDirected evolution is ideal for engineering AAVs because, contrary to rational design, it can test many capsids at a time. As Schaffer explains, \u201cWith rational engineering, you\u2019re basically making one mutation at a time\u2014taking one shot on goal at a time. By doing random mutagenesis, we now have a gene pool over a billion AAV variants. So, we\u2019re not taking shots on goal one at a time. We\u2019re taking a billion shots\u2026all at once.\u201d   \n  \nThose shots on goal have not gone to waste. Fifteen years of hard work have resulted in delivering a virus into the retina to combat several different retinal disorders. Industry connections and collaborations with the Schaffer lab have led to four ongoing gene therapy clinical trials using engineered AAVs in the retina to combat blindness and other eye disorders. The transformation of academic work on wily viruses to direct improvements in human health with clinically tractable treatments that may soon cure patient populations is exactly what Schaffer has always hoped to achieve in his lab. \u201cThe fact that we have gotten technology from our lab at Berkeley into multiple human clinical trials is something I\u2019m very proud of,\u201d Schaffer says.   \n  \n## **Replacing viruses with gold**  \n  \nAlthough AAV-mediated gene delivery has had numerous successes, some researchers are pivoting away from using viruses altogether. Instead, they are overcoming the lingering safety concerns in viruses by creating synthetic carriers to deliver traditional and CRISPR\/Cas9-based therapies. One of the most promising non-viral carriers to deliver CRISPR\/Cas9 into cells is called CRISPR-Gold, invented in the labs of UC Berkeley Bioengineering Professors Niren Murthy and Irina Conboy. Their work has since been catapulted into a start-up called [GenEdit](http:\/\/www.genedit.com\/), founded by Kunwoo Lee, the graduate student in Murthy\u2019s lab who spearheaded CRISPR-Gold.[![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/GeneTherapy\\_4-8.png)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/?attachment\\_id=17966)   \n  \nCRISPR-Gold revolutionized CRISPR\/Cas9 delivery by showing that it was possible to deliver additional gene editing material that would allow CRISPR\/Cas9 to not just destroy, or knock out, a dysfunctional gene, but to correct a dysfunctional gene. The difference between knocking out and fixing is similar to the choice between deleting an entire misspelled word, such as \u201cchocalate\u201d, or replacing the misspelled word with the correctly-spelled word \u201cchocolate.\u201d While the original only requires Cas9 protein and a guide RNA to tell Cas9 which word to cut out, the latter requires an additional piece of material, called donor DNA, that tells the cell the correct version of the word that needs to be replaced. While some disorders result from the chaotic behavior of a mutated and misbehaving protein, other disorders result from the absence of a protein that is not present in the body. Although knocking out a gene may cure patients that belong to the first category of disease, they cannot treat patients belonging to the second category. Rather, the absence of a functional protein can only be fixed by inserting a correct version of the gene encoding the protein.[![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/GeneTherapy\\_3-8-2.png)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/?attachment\\_id=17958)   \n  \nDelivering an additional piece of donor DNA along with the rest of the CRISPR\/Cas9 was not a trivial task. As Murthy explains, \u201cWe focused on a very specific type of problem, which was not just the delivery of the CRISPR protein but also the delivery of the donor DNA. What Kunwoo came up with is he figured out a way of being able to make a nanoparticle that could assemble the Cas9 protein, the guide RNA, and the donor DNA.\u201d Specifically, Kunwoo found that gold had a natural affinity to DNA which could be combined with other CRISPR\/Cas9 components and an additional molecule that helped the whole CRISPR-Gold complex invade cells.   \n  \nWhile gold provided an important starting point for delivering DNA along with Cas9, it also created a problem. Gold is not biocompatible, meaning it can accumulate in human tissue and cause people to become sick. However, GenEdit has managed to replace the gold with a synthetic molecule made of repeating molecular chains, called a polymer. This task was not straightforward. \u201cFor GenEdit to come up with something that works as well as CRISPR-Gold without the gold, they might have had to synthesize thousands of polymers and invested several million dollars,\u201d Murthy says.   \n  \nDespite these difficulties, investing in non-viral delivery methods such as CRISPR-Gold remains important due to the potential increased safety. AAVs exist naturally in the world, and in people with prior exposure to a specific AAV, there is the chance they will have a harmful immune response, similar to Gelsinger\u2019s fatal reaction to lentivirus. Patients are less likely to have been exposed to synthetic nanotechnology, meaning they are less likely to have any sort of allergic reaction.   \n  \nMost importantly, non-viral delivery can better avoid accidental DNA damage. A couple years after Gelsinger died, another clinical trial in Europe cured eighteen children of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) using gene therapy. SCID is better known as bubble boy disease, because if patients are not kept in perfectly sterile environments they will die from a simple cold or infection due to a dysfunctional immune system. While gene therapy cured these children of SCID, following treatment, four of the children developed leukemia, and one of them died from it. The retrovirus used to deliver the gene therapy had randomly inserted some of the DNA in the wrong place, interrupting a part of the children\u2019s genome responsible for preventing cancer.   \n  \nUnintended manipulation of DNA, similar to what occurred with the SCID cases, is called an off-target effect. While CRISPR\/Cas9 gene editing tends to cut DNA more specifically than other viral-based gene editing tools, researchers still worry about Cas9 cutting in the wrong place, especially if it stays around in cells too long. Murthy describes the dilemma: \u201cGene editing is permanent. Once you corrected a mutation, you don\u2019t need the Cas9 protein hanging around afterwards. In fact, having it expressed for long periods of time just increases the frequency of off-target DNA damage, so in the case of gene editing, there are some very compelling reasons to do non-viral gene editing.\u201d Viral-based delivery methods, such as AAV, contain a DNA sequence that results in the continuous production of new Cas9, and AAV lingers in some cells for around five years. In comparison, CRISPR-Gold and other non-viral methods do not contain DNA sequences to produce Cas9 but rather add pre-formed Cas9 protein into their carriers. Cas9 is quickly degraded once it is released from its carriers, with half of it being destroyed after six to twelve hours.   \n  \nWhile potential benefits abound, scientists acknowledge the long battle ahead to elevate non-viral methods to the same status as AAVs. This includes attaining the most coveted prize of all: an FDA-approved treatment using non-viral delivery. AAVs are already FDA-approved, perhaps because they are currently ten to one hundred-times more efficient than non-viral delivery methods. \u201cThe big question with non-viral delivery is: is it going to be possible to get the efficiency needed to have therapeutic effects?\u201d Murthy says. \u201cIt\u2019s an open question whether or not we can improve the efficiency to make it clinically viable.\u201d Nonetheless, researchers around the country, and companies like GenEdit, have already achieved great success in improving non-viral methods   \n  \n## **Other remaining obstacles**  \n  \nDespite the progress in developing delivery methods for gene therapy, several obstacles remain for both *ex vivo* and *in vivo* delivery.   \n  \nOne prominent issue for *ex vivo* delivery is the price and difficulty of introducing DNA or Cas9 into cells. \u201cThe only clinical-grade device filed with the FDA to introduce any editing reagent into cells is an electroporator called MaxCyte. It is large, unwieldy, and difficult to work with,\u201d Urnov says. A significant problem with electroporation is that it requires that cells from patients are exposed to open-air before they are electrically shocked to allow in DNA or Cas9. The consequences of open-air exposure are costly: \u201cIf cells are made to see open-air, in order to put them back into a subject, you have to utter the three most dreaded letters in all of gene and cell therapy: \u2018GMP.\u2019 Good manufacturing practice. And every time you say \u2018GMP,\u2019 you add three to four zeros to the price of anything,\u201d Urnov says.   \n  \nGMP is a set of standardized procedures to help control the quality of reagents that are used in multiple health products such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Although essential for the safety of patients, these practices can often be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. A patient\u2019s own tissue is not subject to GMP when inside a body, but as soon as it is removed from the body and exposed to a laboratory setting, the strict and pricey GMP rules apply.   \n  \nAlthough *in vivo* delivery avoids exposing cells to open air, more work must be done to overcome concerns with AAVs and non-viral carriers. The AAV is only able to carry a small amount of DNA, making it hard to transport whole genes or more complicated treatments to a given cell. Non-viral delivery researchers, meanwhile, are struggling to decrease the size of non-viral carriers made of synthetic molecules. CRISPR-Gold, for example, has mainly been shown to repair DNA in the muscles and brains of mice, because both tissues can be easily targeted using local injections. Most non-viral CRISPR methods are so big that they are unable to be taken up by cells naturally when moving through the bloodstream. Now, labs\u2014including Conboy\u2019s and Murthy\u2019s\u2014are working on creating smaller non-viral delivery methods by attaching Cas9 protein with its guide RNA and donor DNA using small molecular linkers.   \n  \n## **The promises of gene therapy**  \n  \nGene therapy has made incredible progress from its deadly failures in the late 1990s and early 2000s thanks to continuing advances in electroporation, evolved AAVs, and gold nanoparticles. Since the beginning of 2020, at least nine conventional gene therapies have been approved worldwide. The number of traditional and CRISPR\/Cas9-based clinical trials and approvals are only expected to increase in the coming years.   \n  \nGene therapy has completely changed the lives of those who have been cured by it. Victoria Gray, the sickle cell patient successfully treated using CRISPR\/Cas9-based gene therapy in November 2019, has gone from occasionally being unable to move or even feed herself to [thriving](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2020\/06\/23\/877543610\/a-year-in-1st-patient-to-get-gene-editing-for-sickle-cell-disease-is-thriving) ten months later. She describes her cure as incredibly fortuitous, as she is now responsible for raising three of her children alone during the COVID-19 pandemic while her husband is deployed out-of-state by the National Guard. Taking care of her family would never have been possible without gene therapy.   \n  \n-------   \n  \n*Sierra Lear is a graduate student in bioengineering.*   \n  \nDesign: Brittany Daws",

    "markdown":"When the [COVID-19 death count](https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/doh\/covid\/covid-19-data.page) surpassed 170,000 in late summer of 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and major media outlets widely recognized that Black and Hispanic individuals died of COVID-19 more often than White individuals. This trend is not surprising given the countless studies documenting the health disparities affecting minority groups. However, the initial COVID-19 mortality rates from the CDC did not find any major racial differences in [COVID-19 death counts.](https:\/\/covid.cdc.gov\/covid-data-tracker\/#demographics) Instead, it was smaller research efforts at UC Berkeley and other institutions that revealed the inequalities surrounding race and COVID-19.   \n  \nProfessor of Demography [Joshua Goldstein](https:\/\/www.site.demog.berkeley.edu\/josh-goldstein) typically studies social issues related to housing and wages, but when confronted with early statistics that showed no racial disparity in the mortality numbers, he felt he needed to take a deeper look. Goldstein teamed up with postdoctoral researcher Serge Atherwood and together, these two demographers found that the CDC\u2019s method for processing mortality data may have grossly underestimated the death rate for Black and Hispanic communities. In fact, they discovered that, when compared to the White population, the death rates for Black and Hispanic populations were 80 percent and 50 percent higher, respectively.   \n  \nThe CDC\u2019s mortality rates offer vital insight into the pandemic\u2019s progression at a national scale. They are used by public health officials all over the country to see which communities are most vulnerable and to track the efficiency of COVID-19 mitigation efforts. However, mortality rates are not a simple calculation. The raw fatality numbers must be processed to control for confounding factors that may skew the analysis. For example, to account for COVID-19\u2019s high density in urban cities, the CDC adjusted the mortality rates for geographical distribution. In other words, the CDC ensured areas with a dense Black population do not exaggerate the Black mortality rates at a national level. However, Goldstein recognized another important factor not accounted for in the CDC\u2019s early analysis: age.[![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/aylard\\_background-01.jpg)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/uncovering-the-pandemic-divide\/aylard\\_background-01\/)   \n  \nAge is currently the strongest known indicator of COVID-19 mortality, and a population\u2019s average age differs significantly depending on race. \u201cNon-Hispanic White people in the U.S. have an older age structure than every other major racial\/ethnic group,\u201d explains Atherwood. Accounting for age in the calculation is necessary, as a population with more older people will likely have more COVID-19 deaths. When comparing mortality rates between populations\u2014such as comparing a younger Black population to an older White population\u2014not controlling for age will underestimate COVID-19\u2019s impact on Black versus White communities.   \n  \nBy standardizing for age and geography, Goldstein and Atherwood [uncovered a pattern](https:\/\/www.medrxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.05.21.20109116v2) of startlingly high death rates for Hispanic and Black communities across multiple states only two months into the pandemic\u2014far earlier than reported by the CDC. \u201cOne way to interpret [the higher death rate for Black and Hispanic populations] is that although there are fewer older Black people, a higher proportion of them are dying from COVID-19 than White people,\u201d Atherwood explains.   \n  \nAcknowledging the racial disparity earlier on in the pandemic would have been invaluable, according to Dr. Rachel Morello-Frosch, a public health professor and environmental health scientist at UC Berkeley. Having the CDC recognize the gap in mortality rates would have not only permitted earlier action, but also would have allowed public health experts to \u201ctrack the extent to which our interventions may be narrowing that gap,\u201d Morello-Frosch explains.   \n  \nAtherwood and Morello-Frosch agree the notable racial difference in COVID- 19 death rates is rooted in systemic racial inequality. The results show \u201ca pattern consistent with outcomes seen in other realms of social research,\u201d says Atherwood. Likewise, Morello-Frosch finds that \u201cit\u2019s a mirror on the ways in which inequality and the marginalization of certain groups literally manifest in terms of their health status and how vulnerable they are to the emergence of new diseases.\u201d   \n  \n[Many factors could contribute](https:\/\/www.medrxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.08.12.20157271v1.full.pdf) to a higher minority death rate, including differential access to healthcare, an increased risk of infection due to work conditions and greater public transportation use, or a greater proportion of minorities making up the essential workforce. The \u201cracialized division of labor,\u201d as Morello-Frosch calls it, puts minority groups in more essential, high-risk occupations that may increase their chance of infection.   \n  \nWhen the next pandemic inevitably comes, early reporting of precise mortality calculations will be critical, so any underlying racial disparities can be quickly acknowledged and confronted. But ideally, more resources would be focused toward minority communities and their health, as well as educating local health authorities about the most vulnerable communities to diminish or even eliminate the racial disparity in mortality.",

    "markdown":"The 2011 film Contagion became a popular streaming choice in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was lauded as a realistic depiction of the deadly fallout from a new virus that spreads through respiratory droplets. But David Kern, a postdoc in [Steve Brohawn\u2019s lab](http:\/\/www.brohawnlab.org\/) in the molecular and cell biology department at UC Berkeley, keeps thinking about the plot point that seemed least plausible when the movie first hit theaters. \u201cThey resolved the structure of a viral [protein] insanely quickly, and I thought: there\u2019s no way they would be able to know this so soon,\u201d he says. Nine years after Contagion\u2019s release, that part seems less far-fetched as his research group shares the results of their [rapid characterization](https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.06.17.156554v2) of a small protein called 3a, which plays a crucial role in the lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19.   \n  \nKern and Chris Hoel, a graduate student who was also part of the study, are amazed by the \u201cresolution revolution\u201d in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that has transformed their field over the past decade. As structural biologists, they determine a protein\u2019s 3D structure, which, in turn, elucidates its function. Before high-powered computers and high-resolution cameras, scientists had to dissolve many copies of a given protein in water and coax them into forming a stable crystal to get a good picture of the molecule. The problem is that some proteins can take months to crystallize, while others, particularly those like 3a that dissolve in fats instead of water, never do. Cryo-EM, on the other hand, generates a 3D protein structure by stitching together 2D snapshots of a single molecule after it has been flash frozen, circumventing the challenge of crystallization.   \n  \nThe Brohawn lab is one of several research groups around the world that have focused the power of cryo-EM on the proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Their goal is to identify specific viral proteins that are central to a virus\u2019 lifecycle, which can be disrupted with antiviral drugs. The genetic sequence of the 3a protein identified it as a potential viroporin, a viral protein that creates a channel through fatty cell membranes and allows ions\u2014charged particles such as calcium\u2014 to pass through. The ionic concentrations within a human cell are not homogenous because the cell actively moves ions between distinct subcellular regions separated by membranes. This heterogeneity is essential for healthy functioning. A cell that loses control of its ionic concentrations may die and burst open, releasing its contents into the surrounding tissue. By making membranes permeable to ions, viroporins can facilitate the release of a virus\u2019 progeny, which can then infect neighboring cells.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/left-hand-pg-01.jpg) *The 3A protein makes the host cell permeable to ions, which facilitates the release of progeny virus.*   \n  \nTo study 3a, Kern and his team inserted the viral gene into cultured cells, which produced the protein for them. The team then isolated the 3a protein from the cells and tested its permeability to ions, ultimately confirming that it was a viroporin that let through positively charged ions like calcium. Finally, they fired up the electron microscope and resolved its structure. Just a decade ago, biologists may not have even tried to deter- mine the structure of a protein like 3a, but the whole process, from inserting the gene into the cells to producing a 3D model, took about a month to complete. Now the Brohawn lab is working together with its partners in other UC Berkeley labs to identify portions of the 3a protein\u2019s structure that can be disrupted by existing antiviral drugs. \u201cBecause of the very recent resolution revolution in cryo-EM, these targets are more accessible, whereas during the original SARS [outbreak in 2002], [the SARS-CoV-1 virus] just would have been that much more challenging for people to try to study,\u201d says Hoel. It can be hard to appreciate as the pandemic drags on, but the pace of scientific discovery keeps accelerating.[![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/right-hand-pg-01.jpg)](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/toolbox-putting-corona-on-ice\/right-hand-pg-01\/)   \n  \n[divider type=\"thin\"]   \n  \n*Andrew Saintsing is a graduate student in integrative biology*   \n  \nDesign: Allison Hung   \n  \n",

    "markdown":"![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/HeadShot\\_1.jpg)   \n  \nDear Readers,   \n  \nThis is my ninth issue with the Berkeley Science Review over the course of more than four years. With every issue, I am more impressed by the talent and diverse skill set of our team. None of us are professional writers or graphic artists. We are all scientists. But we want to make our world available to our community and strive to make science accessible to anyone who picks up the BSR. That\u2019s what motivates a team of graduate students to set aside time to create a beautiful magazine every semester.   \n  \nThis is also the first BSR issue that was produced completely remotely, as the cover art by Santiago Yori Restrepo reminds us. While all of us here at the BSR have gone through our ups and downs adapting to a new way of life, I think it\u2019s also given us a chance to step back, take stock of what\u2019s important to us, and tackle changes that the BSR has been meaning to implement for a while. Stay tuned in the coming year for some exciting new updates, especially on our website.   \n  \nOf course, we aren\u2019t the only ones who have been working against the odds in 2020. The scientists doing the work described in the following pages have also had to get creative with their research. This is highlighted in the three articles related to the science behind SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: \u201c[Putting corona on ice](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/toolbox-putting-corona-on-ice\/),\u201d \u201c[Uncovering the pandemic divide](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/uncovering-the-pandemic-divide\/),\u201d and \u201c[PPE to the PPEople](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/ppe-to-the-ppeople-2\/).\u201d Other creative scientific solutions can be found throughout this issue. Researchers make breakthroughs in gene therapy in \u201c[First Cas gene delivery](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/first-cas-gene-delivery\/).\u201d A graduate student searches for bats in abandoned mines in this issue\u2019s \u201c[From the field](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/from-the-field-7\/).\u201d And old frog DNA finds a new use for frog conservation in \u201c[Leaping to a bright new future](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/leaping-to-a-brighter-future\/).\u201d   \n  \nHere at the BSR, we have also been having more conversations about how we can better represent all of the scientists at UC Berkeley. We live and work in a diverse community and want to highlight the accomplishments of scientists from many different backgrounds. In this issue, the faculty profiles highlight three new UC Berkeley faculty members: [Zak Al Balushi](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/faculty-profile-zak-al-balushi\/), [Samantha Lewis](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/faculty-profile-samantha-lewis\/), and [Rediet Abebe](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/faculty-profile-rediet-abebe\/), who are changing the long-held ideas of what a scientist should look like and how they should approach their work.   \n  \nBefore you read through this issue of the BSR and enjoy the accompanying illustrations, I\u2019d like to thank a few members of the [BSR team](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/article\/staff-listing-fall-2020\/) for their hard work on this issue. Our Art Director, Santiago Yori Restrepo, rose to the occasion at his new post as head of our design team to produce the beautiful magazine in your hands. Andrew Saintsing, our Managing Editor, juggled the nuts and bolts of the BSR this semester. And a huge thanks to our new Blog Editor in Chief, Maiko Kitaoka, who is revamping the blog and working to create a greater online presence for the BSR.   \n  \nI would like to extend a huge thank you to everyone who contributed financially to the BSR for this issue. Every donation received from individuals and campus departments helps us maintain our operating costs and make improvements. And of course, thank you to the Karmon family. We are incredibly grateful for your support every year.   \n  \nEnjoy Issue 39 of the *Berkeley Science Review*!   \n  \nSincerely,   \n  \nHayley McCausland   \n  \nEditor in Chief   \n  \n[divider type=\"thin\"]   \n  \nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly listed the title of \"PPE to the PPEople\" as \"Preparing for the next surge\"",

    "markdown":"As a first-year undergraduate student at Oregon State University, [Samantha Lewis](https:\/\/www.thelewislab.org\/) discovered a passion for life sciences after enrolling in a developmental biology course to fulfill a requirement for her chemical engineering major. Lewis recalls, \u201cIt was so interesting that I wanted to know everything. It completely changed my world view.\u201d Soon after, Lewis transferred into the zoology department, joined a biology lab, and began to realize her love for research.   \n  \nNow an assistant professor in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) at UC Berkeley, Lewis studies a genome found not in the nucleus but in a separate organelle: the mitochondrion. Our cells contain thousands of small, circular pieces of DNA called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encode genes that control processes required for healthy metabolic function. Similar to the nuclear genome, mtDNA can accumulate defects, or mutations, as a person ages that alter cellular function and can result in rare mitochondrial diseases. \u201cThere is pretty strong evidence that the accumulation of mitochondrial genome defects with age is linked to neurodegeneration and metabolic disease,\u201d Lewis explains. Using a combination of molecular biology tools, gene-editing techniques, and super resolution microscopy, Lewis is studying how the mitochondrial genome changes with age and metabolic conditions.   \n  \nLewis finds great joy in advising future scientists. She has taken part in multiple formal mentoring workshops and is currently involved with [inclusive MCB (iMCB)](http:\/\/mcb.berkeley.edu\/diversity\/inclusive-mcb), an initiative to promote an academically enriching and supportive climate for MCB trainees here at Cal. When asked about her greatest accomplishments, Lewis admits, \u201cI am most proud of seeing the students that I have worked with learn, grow, and succeed.\u201d   \n  \n-------   \n  \n*Erin Akins is a graduate student in Bioengineering.*   \n  \n*Design: Emily Meschke*",

    "markdown":"[Zak Al Balushi](https:\/\/mse.berkeley.edu\/people\\_new\/al-balushi\/), Assistant Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at UC Berkeley, has been coaxing atoms into nanoscale patterns, called crystal structures, since he was an undergraduate student. Materials made from the same elements can have dramatically different properties based on how the atoms are arranged. Consider carbon: if the atoms are organized in a hexagonal pattern, they form graphite. But if the atoms are bonded in a more complex structure, the same carbon atoms form diamond. In the lab, Al Balushi uses sophisticated reaction chambers to encourage atoms to build crystals that don\u2019t form naturally, with the intention of benefiting next-generation electronics similar to how silicon revolutionized microelectronics. \u201cWhen I have a 3D printing analogue for crystal growth to make any crystal on demand\u2014that\u2019s when I can retire,\u201d laughs Al Balushi, \u201cthat would change the world.\u201d   \n  \nAl Balushi\u2019s lab cannot grow all possible materials, so he collaborates with theoretical materials scientists who predict which crystals might have interesting properties.

    "markdown":"\"What we do here as computer scientists affects real people. Our work comes with a huge responsibility,\u201d explains Rediet Abebe, an incoming assistant professor of computer science at UC Berkeley. Abebe tackles problems of social segregation and disparate access to health information\u2014issues typically studied by sociologists, not computer scientists. Her work is interdisciplinary, and even extends beyond the boundaries of academia. \u201cSometimes we don\u2019t realize we are entering a space already occupied by a community, who might have some expertise of their own,\u201d she observes.   \n  \nAbebe\u2019s research is also deeply rooted in her own Ethiopian upbringing. \u201cWithin computer science, it\u2019s not always the case that we embrace our backgrounds and lived experiences as a source of inspiration for our research,\u201d says the native of Addis Ababa. \u201cI\u2019ve found that I am able to work on problems that are meaningful to me and my communities by recognizing the strength that can come from this.\u201d   \n  \nAbebe\u2019s personal connection led her to co-found Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG), a global community of scientists, NGOs, and community leaders researching the problems faced by marginalized communities from a computational lens. It began, she recalls, as a graduate student reading group. These days, MD4SG hosts a yearly conference with over a hundred presentations, and working groups formed of experts from different fields.   \n  \nTogether with an MD4SG working group, Abebe investigated the origins of poverty cycles and identified a contributing factor overlooked by many welfare models: disruptive shocks to a family\u2019s expected income, such as parking tickets and healthcare bills. The result was a way to direct public assistance programs that accounts for a family\u2019s susceptibility to such shocks. Abebe and her team are now working with Poverty Tracker, a study following over 2,000 low-income families in New York. They are analyzing how income shocks compound in the real world, and how the resulting snowball effect can be slowed down or even stopped.   \n  \nLooking forward, Abebe is excited to continue this research on computational aspects of poverty and inequality alongside colleagues within computer science and in collaboration with the interdisciplinary research centers here at UC Berkeley.   \n  \n-------   \n  \n*Orr Paradise is a graduate student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.*   \n  \n*Design: Emily Meschke*",

    "markdown":"A mountain lake is a classic metaphor for serenity\u2014quiet, still, and calm. But in the High Sierra of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park (SEKI), a few hours southwest of Berkeley, the most ecologically healthy lakes are hopping with life. The area is home to birds and snakes, many of which feed on a small frog with a raspy call and brightly-colored thighs: the mountain yellow-legged frog, once the most common amphibian in the Sierra Nevada mountains.   \n  \nUnfortunately, this species is in trouble. Predation and disease have caused the frog population to shrink to a tenth of its original size. The introduction of non-native trout that feed on frogs and invertebrates, has left once-vibrant lakes supporting little else besides gnats and midges. In addition, an insidious fungal disease is rapidly spreading through the frog population. The fungus, *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* (Bd), infects the frogs\u2019 skin and interferes with their ability to breathe and absorb water, often leading to death. Bd is a likely factor in the decline of hundreds of amphibian species [worldwide](https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/32193293\/) and its presence in mountain yellow-legged frogs is a bad sign. Between Bd and the non-native trout, these frogs are \u201cvery much in danger of going to zero,\u201d says Danny Boiano, aquatic ecologist for the National Park Service. Because the frogs were once so plentiful, their loss likely has a profound impact on the ecosystem. Isaac Chellman, environmental scientist for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, explains that the mountain yellow-legged frogs \u201ceat a lot of different invertebrates, and they are also the food source for other animals, including birds and mammals. Undoubtedly they play an integral role in the food web.\u201d   \n  \nAlthough the situation seems dire, researchers and field teams are working hard to save this species, and there are signs of hope. Efforts to remove invasive trout have turned previously inhospitable lakes into prime frog habitats. Lakes in which frogs have been eradicated by Bd could be repopulated by the small fraction of frogs that can persist despite the disease. The process of restoring frogs to empty lakes is most successful when the populations\u2019 genetics are known, since genetically diverse populations are more likely to survive in a new environment. Until recently, though, knowledge of this species\u2019 genetics has been extremely limited. Andrew Rothstein, a UC Berkeley graduate student in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management, set out to understand the frogs\u2019 population genetics within SEKI, a critical refuge for the species.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/frogGenetics\\_webDesign\\_1.png) *New information on the population genetics of the mountain yellow-legged frog in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park (SEKI) has allowed conservationists to strategically reintroduce a genetically diverse population of frogs to previously inhospitable lakes. Photos: Isaac Chellman. Design: Meghan Turner.*   \n  \nGetting a picture of the population genetics across the park, which is larger than Rhode Island and includes thousands of lakes and ponds, was a daunting task. Luckily, as a conservation researcher, Rothstein was well acquainted with the principle of reuse. Hundreds of archived frog skin swab samples already existed in deep freeze but getting useful information from them was no simple matter. Initially taken to detect the mere presence or absence of Bd fungus, the samples contained relatively low amounts of frog DNA and included contaminants that made DNA sequencing difficult. Inspired by similar work from [Thomas Poorten](https:\/\/link.springer.com\/article\/10.1007%2Fs10592-016-0923-5), a previous frog researcher at UC Berkeley, Rothstein made the most of these low-quality samples by focusing on particularly variable regions of the genome.   \n  \nThis unorthodox data collection paid off. By comparing genetic information from frog populations across the park, Rothstein determined which populations were most genetically similar. He also found that populations that had been infected with Bd, which might have been expected to have lost genetic diversity as the population declined, were just as diverse as uninfected populations. \u201cWe could use that diversity to preserve [this species] in the future,\u201d Rothstein says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of shining hope.\u201d   \n  \nBefore Rothstein\u2019s research was even [published](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/mec.15515), conservation teams were using it to guide decisions about restoring frog populations. \u201cThis was a piece that we needed,\u201d says Boiano. \u201cWhen we\u2019re moving frogs around ... we can pick the best source, the closest or most genetically similar source so that we\u2019re being as responsible as possible.\u201d In addition to repopulating lakes with frogs of a similar genetic makeup to the original inhabitants, introducing diverse populations to empty lakes could shift the odds in the frogs\u2019 favor. Frog populations are still in decline, and the fate of the species in SEKI remains very uncertain, but with new information of their population genetics, their future looks a little brighter.   \n  \n-------   \n  \n*Sophia Friesen is a graduate student in molecular and cell biology*   \n  \nDesign: Meghan Turner   \n  \nPhotos: Isaac Chellman",

    "markdown":"![One flying Townsend's big-eared bat and 2 hanging Townsend's big-eared bats in a dark cave.](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/FromtheField-01.png) *Townsend\u2019s big-eared bats (*Corynorhinus townsendii*) in a cave.*   \n  \nLast winter, I drove from my home in Oakland to Bishop, California to meet up with a back-country cowboy ecologist who would accompany me in my search for snoozing bats. Along the border between California and Nevada, a large population of Townsend\u2019s big-eared bats (*Corynorhinus townsendii*) use the cool, humid mine shafts within the White-Inyo Mountains as safe havens for overwintering. These mines, left over from the region\u2019s history, are appealing locations for hibernating bats. They maintain relatively cool, but above-freezing, temperatures and high humidity, which support lower metabolic rates and reduce evaporative water loss in the bats that roost there. While this species remains active at lower elevations during much of the year to feed on plentiful insects and find mates, only females migrate to elevations ranging from 4,500 to 10,000 feet to hibernate throughout the harsh winter.   \n  \nMany temperate bat species\u2014including Townsend\u2019s\u2014have unusual patterns of annual reproduction compared to other small mammals. They mate in the autumn months when males and females spend time foraging for food and roosting in the same spaces, but female bats do not immediately become pregnant. Instead, their reproduction is delayed until spring. Female reproductive physiology is adapted to store sperm and delay ovulation while hibernating. When optimal environmental conditions cycle back in the spring, females impressively manage the energetic demands of flight in addition to pregnancy and lactation\u2014hello baby weight! Because they become pregnant almost immediately upon arousing from hibernation, I wondered whether these \u201cfuture\u201d reproductive costs may affect how female bats manage energy reserves during hibernation, or influence where they decide to cozy-up for the winter.   \n  \nDigging into this question relied on one very elusive thing: finding hibernating bats. In need of help, I somewhat hopelessly emailed a listserv of chiroptologists (people who study bats) and was amazed by the number of replies that filled my inbox. All were pessimistic, except for one. Dr. Michael Morrison, professor and chair within the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences at Texas A&M, wrote, \u201cI know where a lot of Townsend\u2019s hibernate.\u201d   \n  \nAnd so, one year later, I found myself behind the steering wheel of a 4WD rental car filled with field gear and with the windows cracked open just enough to avoid CO2 asphyxiation from sublimating dry ice. I was making my way to the [White Mountain Research Center](https:\/\/www.wmrc.edu\/) situated in the Owens Valley just a few miles beyond the Main Street strip of Bishop. There is something about being in the presence of enormous mountains that makes me emotional, and this particular drive down U.S. Route 395 filled me equal parts nervous energy and sheer joy. Arriving well after dark, I spent the evening counting cotton balls, sterile needles, and small cryovials\u2014a quiet meditation before spending time in the field where everything is a lot less tidy.   \n  \nOver the next week, I made myself a large thermos of coffee every morning before throwing my backpack and boxes into Morrison\u2019s pick-up. We spent each day driving through rocky mountain passes and down gravel paths that I hesitate to call roads. In order to understand how female bats manage their stored energy over winter and the ways that their chosen hibernation location impacts their physiology, we needed to record field measures of body condition and collect samples that I could bring back to the lab at UC Berkeley.   \n  \nAs I wiggled, quite literally, through a small hole in a mountain cranny, I immediately understood why so few people know where bats routinely hibernate and tried to focus on my gratitude for being there, rather than the fact a small earthquake could leave me trapped underground. Once inside, I relied solely on my headlamp to shed light on the jagged rock around me. Confirming the space was just large enough for me to crouch in, I began moving mindfully through the mine using my lamp like a search light sweeping for something small and fuzzy stuck to the rock. Unlike many biologists who capture bats, we don\u2019t need fancy nets or detectors. Our study animals cling quietly to rocks with their delicate toes, their bodies oddly cold to the touch when we find them.   \n  \nAs I recorded mass and body temperature measurements, I found it hard to believe 11-gram bats could be alive with a body temperatures hovering around 59 degrees Fahrenheit (over 30 degrees less than active body temperature). With black leather driving gloves under a pair of nitrile\u2014the biologist\u2019s secret to never getting a bite\u2014I carried each bat out of the mine to work on the bed of the truck. There I let each bat slowly wake up, uncurling its big ears from over its eyes like a sleeping mask and increasing its metabolic rate and body temperature. Once active, it was safe to take a tiny sample of blood, gently wash out some cells from the reproductive tract, and prepare slides. Later, I used the slides to look for blood parasites and check for the presence of sperm that would indicate a female had mated. A small sample of fat, about the size of a grain of rice, was carefully removed and frozen over dry ice and a snippet of soft fur taken from its back and saved in a paper coin envelope. Together, these samples provide information about diet, immune capacity, mating history, and the biochemical molecules stored for energy during hibernation.   \n  \nThe project will highlight how individual animals cope with physiological and energetic challenges, but will also help us learn more about entire bat populations. Bats are an essential component of ecosystems around the globe, as they help control agricultural pests and play important roles in seed dispersal and pollination. Unfortunately, many bat populations have been decimated due to white nose syndrome, a fungus which predominantly affects hibernating bat species by activating their immune response during a time when energy stores are low. Through my work, we will be able to identify various factors that impact energy use and immune system capacity during hibernation\u2014such as reproductive status or microclimate in specific hibernation locations\u2014and learn about strategies that permit some individuals to fare better than others. Ultimately, this may inform conservation efforts regarding population susceptibility as well as individual animal health.   \n  \nAfter checking off the final boxes for sample collection in my field notebook, I walked the bat back to the portal of the mine from which it came. My fingers loosened their grip around its small body, opening my hand enough for the strong female to rest in the palm of my hand. I raised my arm up high to elevate her, giving her room to drop and catch lift. A few delicate steps to the tips of my fingers, and then I felt her let go, only catching a quick glimpse of wide wings gracefully flapping before disappearing into the dark.   \n  \n-------   \n  \nMattina Alonge is a graduate student in integrative biology.   \n  \nImage Design: Shannon O'Brien",

    "markdown":"Surgery is a difficult task. Many times, procedures do not go according to plan even for the most experienced of surgeons. As you might have seen in medical dramas, doctors rush to make quick and lifesaving decisions as a routine surgery suddenly takes a turn for the worse. These moments might be dramatized for television, but they show the intense pressure that medical personnel face when they take responsibility for the lives of their patients.   \n  \nDoctors are not perfect. Even if they know a surgical protocol well, they can easily get tired during long surgeries and become more prone to error. How can we amplify the capabilities of doctors to make their lives easier and our medical outcomes better? Superior training tools, dexterous robots, and artificial intelligence (AI) all have their place in the future of medicine.   \n  \n# Phantom of the opera-tion  \n  \nMedical students and new surgeons learn by doing. But with rare or experimental surgeries hands-on training isn\u2019t always an option.   \n  \nDr. Neil Long, an emergency physician at the Burnaby Hospital in British Columbia, Canada does surgical research focused on pericardiocentesis, a procedure done to remove fluid that has built up around the heart. At best, this excess fluid can cause the heart to malfunction. At worst, the fluid pressure pushes down on and squeezes the heart, making it stop entirely.   \n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly rare procedure,\u201d Long explains. \u201cThe classic mantra of surgery is \u2018see one, do one, teach one,\u2019 and the opportunity to practice on patients in the emergency department for this procedure is far less controlled.\u201d   \n  \nMedicine, however, does not look kindly upon blindly inserting needles into chest cavities. An alternative to \u201csee one, do one, teach one\u201d is a skill trainer, called a phantom. Phantoms are physical models, which do not necessarily look like realistic organs, but mimic their properties. Surgical phantoms often serve as a proxy to help surgeons learn the rudimentary skills needed before working on actual patients. In real life, the surgery will be new, but because trainees have worked with a phantom, they can go in with more confidence in their abilities.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/robotics\\_feature\\_2-5.png) *Molds for low-cost phantoms are 3D printed (left) and filled with gelatin or other materials that mimic tissue (middle). In this example, the resulting object approximates the imaging conditions of an arterial ultrasound procedure (right). Credit: Gautam Gunjala*   \n  \nSuch tools seem almost necessary, but cost plays a major factor in accessibility. A surgeon who wants phantoms for a range of surgical procedures would require a menagerie of them since different phantoms are used for different parts of the body. With regards to pericardiocentesis in particular, \u201cthere\u2019s an existing phantom on the market that\u2019s $3,000,\u201d Long recounts. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s got a tight budget.\u201d   \n  \nWith many of the phantoms on the market for pericardiocentesis doing a poor job of truly capturing the surgical procedure, it makes it hard to justify the cost. As a result, medical researchers are turning to large corporations for help finding ways to take advantage of new technology and bring prices down. Long maintains a strong research relationship with collaborators at Microsoft. Not only does the company bring its considerable resources, but it also provides fresh eyes for old problems.   \n  \nRecently, Microsoft engineers worked with the Burnaby Hospital to design a prototype that is cost efficient and easy to scale into other teaching institutions. \u201cAt least one version of the phantom is as cheap as possible. It\u2019s a relatively small cost that people can afford,\u201d Long explains.   \n  \nInterested surgical trainees would simply need to download code and pay someone to print the phantom\u2019s molds on a 3D printer. Materials that mimic tissue are then added to the printout making a better phantom model than what is currently on the market. As the field of 3D printing advances and 3D printers become more affordable, a world in which medical students can practice life-saving procedures without the stress of operating on a real person appears more realistic.   \n  \n# A call to arms: robotic surgeons  \n  \nSurgeons are also turning to robotic surgery in order to enhance their skills. \u201cSurgeons\u2019 acceptance of robots falls into several camps,\u201d explains Dr. Michael Mastrangelo of Bend Surgical Associates. Mastrangelo was an early adopter of minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery in the 1990s and then robotic surgery when the technology became available. \u201cSome feel that robots shouldn\u2019t be used at all, and others believe that robotic surgery is where surgery is eventually going.\u201d   \n  \nMany surgeons were hesitant to move into the age of robotics\u2014robots are bulky, require a protracted setup, add additional cost to the patient, and require a hospital setting as opposed to an outpatient surgery center. As technologies improved, however, it became evident that robotic surgeries could outshine laparoscopic ones in several cases, including prostatectomies, colon resections, and hysterectomies. Furthermore, certain \u201copen surgery\u201d procedures could now become minimally invasive ones. Mechanical improvements were a major factor.   \n  \n\u201cImagine you\u2019re trying to tie your shoes with your wrist locked,\u201d says Mastrangelo. \u201cThat\u2019s what laparoscopic surgery is like. Laparoscopic instruments don\u2019t have wrists, but robotic instruments give you additional freedom to move\u2014more of an intuitive natural movement when you\u2019re tying a knot and suturing.\u201d   \n  \nIn the last two decades the invention of new surgical robots has made the promise of robots in the operating room into a more tangible reality. The da Vinci Surgical System is behind the famed viral video of \u201cgrape surgery\u201d where it successfully reattaches the peel of a tiny grape. Designed to perform delicate and minimally invasive movements, the da Vinci System is quickly gaining traction in many hospitals.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/robotics\\_feature\\_3-720x450.png) *In current clinical practice, a surgeon uses the console of the da Vinci System to perform surgical tasks using interactive robotic arms. Artificial intelligence researchers aim to enable this system to perform some tasks without console input. Credit: Gautam Gunjala*   \n  \nThe da Vinci System is operated by a surgeon, who sits at a console looking at an image of the surgical field. The surgeon controls four interactive robotic arms, which perform the surgery. Surgeons like it for many reasons, including improved visualization, dexterous flexibility, and the ability to stay seated throughout the surgery to reduce fatigue.   \n  \nEven though the surgeon is not standing above the patient, there continues to be a team in the operating room. Communication systems are in place so that surgeons can talk to their operation team. And in the rare case that an open procedure becomes necessary, the da Vinci System can come off very quickly.   \n  \n# Robotic trainers  \n  \nThe da Vinci System can also be outfitted with two consoles, so two surgeons can operate it simultaneously. A trainee may be seated at one console and an experienced surgeon at the other. If the trainee performs a movement that could cause a surgical issue, the experienced surgeon can take control of the system.   \n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s a great tool for training,\u201d says Mastrangelo. \u201cWhen training in laparoscopic surgery you essentially give up the reins. There\u2019s a safety factor in having the ability to have more than one console. A lot of [surgical] metrics come out of the da Vinci, too. You learn a lot about how you operate and can work to improve on becoming a better surgeon.\u201d   \n  \nThe system even allows for virtual input. A surgeon in another facility, perhaps thousands of miles away, can sit in on surgeries with trainees, observe their techniques, and make recommendations. When today\u2019s trainees are full-fledged doctors, an AI may be the one observing their techniques and making recommendations on how to improve. But before these computer algorithms can evaluate surgeons, they must be trained in surgery. To do so, an AI uses machine learning, the ability of computers to automatically learn and improve through experience.   \n  \nIn supervised machine learning, an AI learns from a \u201ctraining\u201d dataset. The AI is given \u201cinputs\u201d\u2014data like videos, pictures, and numerical values\u2014and the \u201cground truth\u201d or the set of correct predictions the AI is to make based on the inputs. The process is similar to the way students study with an answer key in the back of a textbook. This key is made by the authors, who are certain of what the answers are. Students try to solve these questions by plunging into the problems directly, then checking if their responses match with the answer key at the back. They know they are solving the problems correctly if the answers they are coming up with consistently match. If not, they try to reformulate their theories and try again so the answers do conform.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/robotics\\_feature\\_4.png) *In supervised learning, data (video frames) and annotations (kinematic measurements, gesture labels) are used to train a neural network to plan a manipulator trajectory for a task. In semi-supervised learning, not all video frames are annotated. Credit: Gautam Gunjala*   \n  \nTranslational researchers, who bring bench science to bedside medicine, have found that the da Vinci System can serve as a tool to generate training data that can be used to improve both AI and medical outcomes. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Intuitive Surgical Link used the robotic surgeon to create the Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set, known as JIGSAWS. JIGSAWS was initially created as a training dataset for AIs that evaluate the performance of surgeons during suturing. Eight surgeons of different skill levels used the da Vinci System to complete tasks thought to be the core of the surgery: suturing, knot tying, and needle passing. The dataset includes videos of the robot\u2019s arms in action and kinematic data describing the arms\u2019 motions. In addition, each video has corresponding manual annotations that break down the tasks into discrete actions and that rate the surgeon\u2019s performance. Experienced surgeons helped the Johns Hopkins team produce the annotations. AIs using JIGSAWS as the team intended will treat the videos and kinematic data as inputs and the manual annotations as the ground truth. These AIs will learn to break future surgical videos down into distinct surgical tasks so that they can then evaluate and rate the skill-level of the surgeon.   \n  \n# Artificially intelligent surgeons  \n  \nDrs. Ajay Tanwani and Ken Goldberg, researchers in the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department at UC Berkeley, found a different use for JIGSAWS. Their team, along with collaborators from Google and Intel, developed the Motion2Vec algorithm that can learn how to operate the da Vinci System by watching human surgeons. The dataset\u2019s focus on suturing was fortuitous. As it\u2019s one of the most foundational tasks in surgery, being able to offload suturing to a surgical AI would allow surgeons to focus on more technical and unpredictable surgical tasks. \u201cSuturing is something that is very tedious,\u201d explains Goldberg. \u201cIt\u2019s delicate work, but we\u2019re trying to push that envelope slowly forward.\u201d   \n  \nThe problem is that JIGSAWS provides a limited amount of data, and experiencing many surgeries would produce a better surgical AI. Along the same lines, access to varied training cases makes better AI surgeons. The AI may need to choose between various surgical actions, such as needle insertion, needle handoff, or needle extraction. A good medical AI would overcome these issues by being trained on examples from all possible scenarios.   \n  \nThis makes the amount of data required to train a medical AI enormous. Data must not only be supplied in such a way that the algorithm understands it, but also in large enough quantities. That sort of information cannot come from a few minutes of video or a few pictures. Hundreds of hours of data must be spliced together. The best results would come if all of those data were annotated, but annotations take time.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/robotics\\_feature\\_5-720x450.png) *The JIGSAWS dataset contains videos captured by the da Vinci System during surgical processes, supplemented by two types of annotations. Kinematic annotations descibe the positions and velocities of the surgeon-side and patient-side manipulators at each video frame. Surgical activity annotations break down a complex procedure into sub-tasks which are associated with sequences of frames. Credit: Gautam Gunjala*   \n  \nDr. Danyal Fer, a resident in the University of California San Francisco East Bay Surgery Program, emphasizes, \u201cSurgeons who are working eighty hours a week find it hard to sit down and accurately annotate what is occurring in a surgical scene [to assist with supervised learning]. Any method you can create to generate a dataset more quickly and accurately is going to be helpful in this space.\u201d   \n  \nTo develop Motion2Vec with limited help from surgeons, the UC Berkeley team trained their algorithm on JIGSAWS using \u201csemi-supervised learning.\u201d They fed Motion2Vec a small number of videos labeled with the information the robot needed to imitate the actions in those videos. To supplement the annotated videos, they also fed the algorithm video data without labels. It was up to Motion2Vec to group unlabeled videos together with similarly labeled video data so that it could amass enough examples to closely imitate the recorded surgical actions. If the algorithm grouped videos incorrectly, the movements it produced would fail to match the ground truth, so it would be forced to reevaluate itself and adjust its groupings.   \n  \nMotion2Vec is not going to be launched into da Vinci Systems in the operating room anytime soon, but the research group has come up with some promising results. Their AI was able to mimic the movements of skilled surgeons with an accuracy of 85.5 percent, suggesting that the robot can reproduce the motion of a surgeon relatively closely.   \n  \nYet, there are still limitations in training an algorithm on JIGSAWS. \u201cThese annotations take place in a controlled environment,\u201d explains Fer. \u201cIn the future, you must be able to accurately describe what the surgeon is doing in an operation with far more detail, in a much more complex, and a much less controlled environment.\u201d   \n  \nLearning from less controlled datasets is not an easy task for an AI. Recognizing a surgeon\u2019s skilled hand movements and imitating them requires a thorough understanding of not just the motions themselves, but also differences in lighting, background, and other geometric properties. That makes it important to characterize factors such as position, size of external objects, and the viewpoint of the camera. Still, if researchers can pull it off, the possibilities are limitless. \u201cThe world around us is filled with information in the form of videos, images, and text,\u201d says Tanwani. \u201cIf [AIs] are to make sense of this information\u2014similar to how humans perceive and act in their environments\u2014[they] can be of tremendous value in everyday life.\u201d   \n  \n# Ethics of artificial intelligence in biomedicine  \n  \nAlthough artificial intelligence is steadily becoming more common in medicine, it will not be taking your doctor\u2019s job any time soon. A precise algorithm does not replace a seasoned physician. Writing an AI is a highly specialized task which only covers a small fraction of the patient cases and conditions. Doctors and surgeons are capable of looking at hundreds of things at once and drawing conclusions based on a patient\u2019s medical and familial history, not just physical symptoms. There will not be an AI in the foreseeable future that can equal a doctor.   \n  \n\u201cThe first real tangible milestone of [AI]-assisted surgery would be to have robots that are semi-operated,\u201d Tanwani explains. Surgeons would be in complete control of the robot, but the AI would show them a way to correct erroneous movements. \u201cIf we have the right quality of data available,\u201d says Tanwani, \u201cwe can incorporate [these AIs] as standard models that can be used for training and assisting novice surgeons, as well as providing feedback to experts on how to control these robots.\u201d   \n  \nA full rollout of AI in the surgical force would have serious implications for patients and clinicians alike. Some ethicists believe that the AI must do a statistically better job than the average medical professional. Others take a stronger stance that AI must do no harm. \u201cThe debate parallels that of self-driving cars,\u201d comments Fer, \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance a self-driving car is better than your average driver. But every time a self-driving car has a problem, it is a big deal.\u201d   \n  \nFrom a societal level, it\u2019s unclear what errors would be acceptable from a machine as opposed to a human. Patients may look at it from a place of accountability: who is responsible for surgical or diagnostic error if things were to go awry? In such a situation, does liability fall to the surgeon overseeing the surgery, the physician supervising the diagnosis, the hospital in which the surgery takes place, the doctors involved in creating the training dataset, or the company which created the AI?   \n  \n\u201cThe errors you see in an autonomous system are going to be different from the errors you see occur in a human-driven system,\u201d Fer explains. \u201cIf I\u2019m suturing a blood vessel, I might not make all the sutures evenly spaced but an autonomous system could completely misread the environment\u2014suturing a centimeter off in a completely different part of the blood vessel.\u201d   \n  \n\u201cWe do not anticipate replacing surgeons altogether,\u201d concurs Goldberg. \u201cI don\u2019t think robots are capable of replacing people. But they can make people\u2019s jobs better\u2014just like driver-assist makes drivers better drivers, surgeon-assist would make surgeons better surgeons.\u201d   \n  \nIt is possible AI and surgical robots in the operating room will one day factor heavily into the surgical process. There is perhaps even a chance these technologies will feature as a storyline on your favorite medical drama. From correcting erroneous movements to preventing tragic accidents, there is immense promise in using technology in the operating theater. Scientists and clinicians are working hand in hand to create a surgical field that is safer for patients and less risky for doctors. Modern tools including phantoms, AI, and robotic technology are at the disposal of surgeons\u2014giving them confidence before making the cut.",

    "markdown":"The last three fire seasons have been the deadliest and most devasting California has seen. As climate change is a primary culprit to these devastations, mitigation strategies need to be scaled-up and implemented. Energy resiliency\u2014the assurance that electricity will be deployed at any given moment to satisfy the needs of customers\u2014is essential in today\u2019s world. But clean energy, which is critical for reducing greenhouse gases and slowing climate change, typically sacrifices resiliency. Common clean energy sources like solar and wind cannot provide round-the-clock power like traditional energy sources including natural gas, oil, and coal. At large refineries, natural gas is burned and through the breakage of bonds, heat and carbon dioxide are released. While intermittency can be mitigated by storing excess energy in batteries, batteries alone are not enough to solve our energy problems. Hydrogen may be a solution.   \n  \nMade up of the most abundant atoms in the world, hydrogen gas, or H2, contains a lot of energy in the form of chemical bonds. To convert the chemical energy into electricity, the hydrogen gas must be fed into a fuel cell, where it is split into protons and electrons at an electrode. The protons move through the fuel cell (via an electrolyte) and the electrons move externally through a wire, generating the electricity. The electrons and protons recombine at the opposite electrode, completing the chemical reaction. This chemical process happens spontaneously and can generate power on the mega- to giga-watt scale. The only byproducts are heat and water!   \n  \nBut there is a catch. Fuel cells mostly use hydrogen that is produced by burning methane, a process that releases a large amount of carbon dioxide. To harness this promising technology for clean energy storage, we can produce hydrogen cleanly using an electrolyzer. An electrolyzer is a fuel cell run backward, using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.   \n  \n![Schematic of electrical energy from wind power being turned into hydrogen gas with an electrolyzer. Hydrogen gas is put through a fuel cell to obtain electricity. ](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Figure-2Artboard-4.png) *Long-term energy storage can be achieved using an electrolyzer to convert water and electricity to hydrogen gas. When electricity is needed, a fuel cell converts the hydrogen gas back into electricity. Design: Natalie Goh*   \n  \nThis clean hydrogen can be made during peak production hours when excess energy is generated. Think of a sunny summer day when many people are enjoying their day outside and not using excess energy. By siphoning off some energy during these peak production times, hydrogen gas can be made and stored in tanks. According to Zachary Taie, a Ph.D. candidate at Oregon State University, \u201ctwo huge incentives for using hydrogen is the energy storage (the tank) is decoupled from the energy conversion (the electrolyzer and fuel cell) and the storage of hydrogen is stable over long time scales, weeks, months, years, which cannot be said for current energy storage technologies just yet.\u201d   \n  \nThe Department of Energy is funding multi-million-dollar projects, like the [H2@scale program](https:\/\/www.energy.gov\/eere\/fuelcells\/h2scale), to accelerate progress in renewable hydrogen energy technology. The main challenge is decreasing the cost of the systems to scale-up operations. But hydrogen fueling stations are already being approved and the technology development is on its way to meet the demands of the market. Hydrogen fuel cells are replacing the combustion engines in vehicles such as the AC transit buses around the East Bay and heavy-duty trucks, like the ones Nikola Motors is deploying. Fuel cells are also being used as stationary power systems to replace diesel generators, such as Bloom Energy in the South Bay.   \n  \nClean and storable, hydrogen may be our best shot at weaning ourselves off of fossil fuels. As Staff Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, [Dr. Nemanja Danilovic](https:\/\/daniloviclab.lbl.gov\/) puts it, \u201cIt is hard to put a value on energy resiliency; renewable energy plus short-term and long-term storage can provide undisrupted energy for hospitals, homes, and towns in the future.\u201d Hydrogen is one clean solution for long-term storage. From the perspective of Grace Anderson, a chemical engineering Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, \u201cThe effects of climate change are becoming more apparent, especially here in California. The need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is great, and I believe hydrogen has a large role to play in eliminating reliance on fossil fuels.\u201d It alone is not the silver bullet for addressing climate change but coupled with batteries, solar, wind, and other renewables, our dependence on non-renewables can be weakened and a cleaner energy landscape can be achieved.   \n  \n-------   \n  \n*Julie Fornaciari is a graduate student in chemical engineering.*   \n  \nDesign: Natalie Goh",

    "markdown":"The mutant flies have just enough leg room. The temperature of their incubators is carefully tuned, humidity a comfortable sixty percent. Five thousand fruit flies are enjoying a Goldilocks standard of luxury. Their concierge, biologist Emily Brown, is waiting for them to die.   \n  \nAn alumnus of Doris Bachtrog's. lab, Professor of Integrative Biology at UC Berkeley, Brown created this fly spa to study the link between sex and ageing. Female fruit flies enjoy longer lives than their male counterparts. These flies aren't alone-most bird and mammal species have one sex that outlives the other. Researchers like Brown, now a Senior Scientist at NYU Medical Center, suspect this lifespan gap is caused by sex chromosomes. They just need a way to prove it.   \n  \nDoing so is difficult. Animals of different sexes have different lifestyles, which affect ageing along with genetics. And no one quite understands the genetics of ageing. Unlike eye color or blood type, lifespan isn't a trait that can be pinned down to a handful of genes. And genes are only a fraction of an organism's DNA.   \n  \nThe function of genes is well-understood. Like books in a library, they hold blueprints for the proteins a cell needs to grow, survive and divide. The remaining DNA, known as heterochromatin, seems to be both library and librarian. Some elements are structural. Others monitor the genome, flagging genes that need to be read or re-shelved. And some heterochromatin isn't helpful. Like rogue librarians scribbling on pages, particularly repetitive sections of DNA can insert nonsense into genes.   \n  \nAs organisms age, they grow worse at stopping this troublesome DNA. Those with a Y chromosome do an especially dismal job, a feature that grabbed Brown's focus during her PhD. \"I was interested in the consequences of having different sex chromosomes,\" says Brown. Rapid ageing might be one consequence-in every species with a lifespan gap, the shorter-lived sex has the equivalent of a Y chromosome.   \n  \nThis may be due to the composition of the Y chromosome, which contains great swathes of repetitive DNA. In some species, these sections make up almost the entire chromosome. This is risky-if even one element finds its way to a gene, it can do permanent damage. In contrast, the X chromosome is often densely packed with genes, with little space for repetitive elements, and tends to be much better behaved. If both sexes have the same total ability to protect their genomes, those defenses could quickly stretch thin if a Y chromosome is in the mix.   \n  \nTo test this theory, there's no lab rat better than the fruit fly-some variants have incredibly repetitive Y chromosomes. Another advantage is speed. If you want to study ageing, you need to wait for subjects to get old, so a fruit fly's seventy-day lifespan comes in handy. But Brown was also drawn to the species by the unusual role its Y chromosome plays in determining sex.   \n  \nFor mammals, an organism with a Y chromosome is male. However, a fruit fly can carry a Y chromosome and remain female. For these insects, sex is determined solely by the number of X chromosomes: one for male, two for female. Through careful cross-breeding, Brown created several strains of fly with abnormal numbers of chromosomes, including females with Y chromosomes and males without.   \n  \nIf the lifespan gap was caused only by differences in lifestyle between the sexes, this meddling would have no effect. But as Brown looked after the flies, checking on their vials daily and counting how many remained alive, she saw an entirely new relationship between sex and ageing emerge. \"There's actually a really dramatic change,\" says Brown. When she added a Y chromosome to typically long-lived females, the flies aged rapidly. When she took the Y away from males, leaving them with a lone X chromosome, their odds of surviving shot up. \"They just kept on living,\" says Brown. The worst-off flies were a set of males Brown bred with two Y chromosomes. On average these mutants only made it halfway through the lifespan of the X-only strain.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/brief\\_female\\_lifespan.jpg) *As time passes, the flies with a Y chromosome (green and yellow) age faster, and die, before flies with fewer Y chromosomes (yellow) or no Y chromosomes (pink), regardless of the flies sex.*   \n  \nThe Y chromosome is toxic. It's the only way to explain the brief but luxurious lives of Brown's flies. But Brown and her colleagues are quick to acknowledge there is much more to lifespan than one troublesome chromosome. As Allison Nguyen, the PhD student continuing Brown's study, puts it, \"We are only really studying one slice of this phenomenon called ageing.\" An animal's environment, what it eats, and when it mates all influence how long it will live. Since a human's' Y chromosome is not quite as repetitive as a fruit fly's (there are a couple more genes to cram in), it likely influences ageing much less than these lifestyle factors do. However, the toxicity of a more sophisticated Y chromosome still needs to be studied, and this is how Nguyen will use the fly spa next.   \n  \n-------   \n  \nAuthor: Andrea Herman is a graduate student in Physics.   \n  \nImage Design: Julia Torvi   \n  \n",

Many plastics contain endocrine-, or hormone-, disrupting chemicals (EDCs), such as bisphenol A (BPA), which commonly lines food and drink containers. EDCs can alter fertility with chronic exposure, but acute effects are not well studied. [Polina Lishko's lab](https:\/\/lishkolab.org\/) in UC Berkeley\u2019s Department of Molecular and Cell Biology recently studied the effects of four EDCs on male fertility. They focused on di-ethyl hexyl phthalate, or [DEHP](https:\/\/www.atsdr.cdc.gov\/substances\/toxsubstance.asp?toxid=65), a chemical found in shower curtains, dolls, and medical tubing. DEHP exposure occurs through ingestion, inhalation, or skin absorption.

    "markdown":"When plans were first proposed to convert the aging steam plant on UC Berkeley\u2019s campus into a combined heat and power cogeneration facility in the late 1970s, it was seen as a major innovation in energy efficiency. Thirty years later, the aging facility is presenting campus leadership with a problem: UC Berkeley is directly responsible for the emissions associated with the cogeneration plant, which, as of last year, accounted for 73 percent of the university\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions. Given UC Berkeley\u2019s pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025\u2014and the increasing age of the plant\u2014the university now faces a time-sensitive decision about the cogeneration plant\u2019s future. The challenge of how best to provide energy to UC Berkeley\u2019s campus involves not only the science of energy, sustainability, and resiliency, but also additional interactions with political and cost-related human factors, making this a particularly complex issue to resolve.   \n  \n## What is a cogeneration plant?  \n  \nIn a traditional coal-fired power plant, fuel is burned, emitting heat and greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. The heat generated from this process is used to boil water into steam, which then passes through a turbine to produce electricity. However, only around 30-50 percent of the energy released from coal is converted into electricity, and the excess steam is condensed into liquid water and sent back to the plant. On the other hand, cogeneration\u2014or cogen\u2014plants produce both electricity and steam for the community. Cogen plants achieve much higher efficiencies of 65-75 percent by capturing the steam produced while making electricity and using it to heat buildings. This process also reduces the need to burn additional fossil fuels to generate steam from a boiler or steam generator. CO2 emissions from cogen plants are accordingly significantly lower than separate coal-fired electricity and steam plants per unit of electrical production.   \n  \nUC Berkeley\u2019s cogen plant increases its efficiency even further by using natural gas as its fuel source, which generates roughly half the CO2 emissions of coal. However, cost, rather than efficiency, motivates this choice of fuel source. Norris Herrington, the manager of UC Berkeley\u2019s cogen plant, says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to truck [natural gas] in. It comes in in a pipeline and it\u2019s cheap on a per unit basis.\u201d He elaborates that the cost of shipping in diesel or coal would be \u201ca heck of a lot more.\u201d   \n  \nDespite being more energy efficient than their counterparts, cogen facilities tend to be less common than traditional power plants because, unlike electricity, it is hard to transport steam over large distances. This transportation difficulty means that any institution using steam generated from a cogen plant needs to be close by\u2014\u201chalf a mile away maybe, or a quarter of a mile down the road,\u201d according to Herrington. The steam generated by UC Berkeley\u2019s cogen plant is distributed to approximately 120 buildings on campus for heating and cooling. To reach each building, the steam travels across campus through a series of underground tunnels. Although they are filled with hazards including hot steam, asbestos, and radon gas, these tunnels previously served as a tourist attraction, student haunt, shortcut between lectures, and\u2014allegedly\u2014an escape route for the chancellor fleeing student protests in the 1960s. The steam tunnels have since been sealed off, but students can still see the steam that leaks out from gratings and manholes around campus.   \n  \nWhile the cogen plant was initially able to meet 100 percent of the campus\u2019s energy needs when it first opened in 1987, due to large increases in the campus population, it now supplies an average of 92 percent of campus\u2019s power demand while operating at maximum capacity. Additional electricity is supplemented by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E). The plant can occasionally produce more energy than the campus needs at off-peak times, such as nights and weekends, but the capacity to store the excess energy produced is not yet available. As Herrington explains, \u201cYou can\u2019t really store that amount of energy in a battery\u201d because of current limitations on batteries\u2019 maximum storage capacity and lifetime.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/01\\_Cogeneration\\_Web-1.png) *Design: Emily Gonthier*   \n  \n##   \n  \n## Cogen versus the 2025 carbon neutrality goals  \n  \nUC Berkeley\u2019s cogen plant was initially owned by a third party, which sold its steam to the campus and its power to PG&E. However, after the third party\u2019s lease for the plant expired in 2017, campus leadership made the decision to take over ownership of the plant because UC Berkeley wanted a greater stake in the plant\u2019s future. Sally McGarrahan, the associate vice chancellor for facilities at UC Berkeley, explains, \u201cWe saw the energy world changing, and locking ourselves into another long-term arrangement with an owner operator would have limited our options for managing our own decisions.\u201d   \n  \nWith ownership, however, comes direct responsibility for the emissions associated with the plant. In subscribing to the UC-wide Carbon Neutrality Initiative, the campus has committed to being carbon neutral for building and fleet energy use by 2025. This pledge puts the future of the cogen plant in doubt, given that it runs off natural gas\u2014 a fuel which accounts for almost two-thirds of UC Berkeley\u2019s emissions. While McGarrahan believes that \u201cthe simplest, cheapest thing to do would be to fix the plant we have now,\u201d she says that the campus is considering a range of options to meet the campus\u2019s energy needs for the future and to fulfill President Napolitano\u2019s carbon neutrality pledge.   \n  \nNot everyone believes that the natural-gas run cogen plant is truly damaging for the environment. While natural gas is a fossil fuel, the carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions associated with its combustion are much lower than those of coal and oil. As a result, some, including Herrington, consider it a relatively clean fuel. Herrington argues, \u201cCalifornia is about the only place that doesn\u2019t consider natural gas clean. In every other state in the country natural gas is clean; that\u2019s what I grew up hearing.\u201d Combustion emissions, however, are not the only source of greenhouse gas emissions associated with natural gas. The drilling and extraction of natural gas from wells and its transportation in pipelines can also result in leakages of methane, a greenhouse gas that traps even more heat than CO2. The process of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, typically used to extract natural gas, is also associated with significant environmental impacts, such as increased erosion, ground and surface water contamination, and earthquakes. Dan Kammen, professor of energy at UC Berkeley who works on decarbonizing energy systems worldwide, vehemently disagrees with Herrington about the environmental impact of natural gas: \u201cIt\u2019s not relatively clean\u2014that\u2019s just a lie. It\u2019s a fossil fuel,\u201d citing the greenhouse gases produced from both burning and leaked natural gas.   \n  \nUC Berkeley has already reduced emissions from the plant since reclaiming ownership by making significant changes to its operations, but it\u2019s not enough. Reducing the plant\u2019s output during the evening when less energy is needed\u2014rather than running it at full capacity all the time\u2014has slightly lowered its greenhouse gas emissions, but far more significant and extensive reductions in natural gas usage and energy generation are required in order to meet the 2025 carbon neutrality goals. As McGarrahan says, \u201cEverything is on the table to figure out how to move towards carbon neutrality under a cost model that we can make happen.\u201d Options currently being considered range from keeping the plant open with adaptions to decommissioning it entirely.   \n  \n## Rethinking the cogen plant  \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/02\\_CogenUpgrade\\_Web.png) *Design: Emily Gonthier*   \n  \nIf UC Berkeley continues to use the cogen plant, the campus will have to modify infrastructure in the plant itself to make it more energy efficient. Ideas of reforming the plant are driven by the cogen facility\u2019s age. Herrington believes that the 33-year-old plant has around 10 years left: \u201cIt\u2019s probably getting on up there in age, but personally I think we could make it until 40.\u201d As a result of the plant\u2019s age, significant and expensive upgrades are necessary to keep it operational at its current capacity, but these upgrades also provide a convenient opportunity to improve the plant beyond its current state. As McGarrahan explains, \u201cWe should certainly invest towards the future instead of just thinking of the immediate.\u201d UC Berkeley had one of the first cogen plants across the UC system, so the plant is now one of the first to approach the end of its expected life. \u201cWe hope to set a path for these other campuses as they come to the end of their cogen\u2019s life,\u201d she says.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/03\\_Biogas\\_Web.png) *Design: Emily Gonthier*   \n  \nBut, just like natural gas, biogas also comes with several disadvantages. The largest concern is the limited availability and transportation infrastructure of biogas nationwide. Biogas currently is not considered a scalable alternative to natural gas, with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimating that the current biogas resources in the US would only satisfy 1.5 percent of its natural gas consumption. Herrington also believes that biogas is not be a feasible solution from a financial perspective, stating that the UC Office of the President\u2019s investments in \u201csome biogas in Louisiana or something \u2026 really aren\u2019t economically viable and wouldn\u2019t exist if they weren\u2019t being subsidized.\u201d Kammen additionally calls the discussion about non-renewable fuels, such as biogas, \u201cunfortunate.\u201d He questions the feasibility of switching out natural gas for lower-carbon biofuels: \u201cThe more we dig in on [fuel alternatives], the more we discover this is just not a viable pathway.\u201d Kammen also explains that biofuels often come at the expense of forests or crops and require high levels of pesticides and irrigation to cultivate, resulting in higher carbon emissions than initially apparent. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to invest in things which we know aren\u2019t sustainable,\u201d he says.   \n  \nAlternatively, campus could create a new hybrid heating and electricity system, using the cogen plant only for emergency backup. In such a system, the majority of the campus\u2019s heating needs would derive from a heat pump\u2014an externally powered device that transports heat from one place to another\u2014while electricity would be mainly sourced from the grid. Meanwhile, the cogen plant\u2019s operation would be reduced to provide backup power, for instance, in an electricity shutdown, and to serve as a backup source of heat when it is cold. This strategy is similar to the route taken by the natural gas-run cogen plant at UC San Diego, which is now only used as a backup when biogas and solar photovoltaic sources are insufficient to meet the campus\u2019s energy needs. Kammen cites the UC San Diego campus as a potential guide for a similar transition to 100 percent clean energy. \u201cWe know it can work. UC San Diego essentially already has such a plan\u2014they\u2019re not entirely there, but they went to batteries and solar and we need to do a version of that,\u201d he says.   \n  \nHowever, he also acknowledges that in order to get the Berkeley campus off fossil fuels entirely we \u201cneed to push more aggressively.\u201d Kammen suggests that reducing the cogen plant to a backup power source would mean that UC Berkeley would still ultimately be reliant on natural gas and fossil fuels. He advocates for fully decommissioning the plant and powering the campus through purchased electricity and renewables alone in order for UC Berkeley to take the bigger, bolder active steps and really \u201cwalk the walk.\u201d   \n  \n## Shutting down the cogen plant  \n  \nThe most aggressive plan to meet the carbon-neutral pledge is to fully decommission the cogen plant and instead use energy generation from entirely renewable sources. In such a scenario, most of the campus\u2019s electricity would come from PG&E, which generates 86 percent of its electricity from greenhouse gas-free sources as of 2019, with an additional contribution from on-site solar and fuel cells. Since the campus is land and sun poor, it could not rely on its own renewable sources alone to fully meet its electricity demands.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/05\\_FuelCells\\_Web.png) *Design: Emily Gonthier*   \n  \nMary Ann Piette, a staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL) whose research focuses on building energy efficiency efforts, also emphasizes the need to transition away from heating via steam, which she calls \u201cvery inefficient and very leaky.\u201d She instead cites systems like the district heating and cooling system that was recently installed at Stanford, where stores of hot and cold water are kept and pumped around the campus, because \u201cwater is a lot more efficient to pump around than steam.\u201d She also mentions the potential of new systems currently being used in Europe, where water is stored in pipes underground and heated when needed using pumps that extract thermal energy from the ground. \u201cThere are all sorts of ideas around these super-efficient heating and cooling systems, which UC Berkeley is a potential candidate for,\u201d she says.  \n  \nHowever, the cost of decommissioning the plant is a serious disadvantage. According to Herrington, when Stanford recently shut down their \u201cperfectly good\u201d cogen plant to transition to their all-electric hot water system, it wasn\u2019t cheap: \u201cMy estimates are, if we went all electric with some sort of hot water system, the cost would be a quarter of a million dollars, and then you\u2019re talking $25 million a year more in terms of electric bills.\u201d He says, \u201cWhile the price of natural gas is staying flat, PG&E\u2019s price is going up 6-7 percent each year.\u201d Technological advances have made it possible to produce more natural gas than meets demand, but PG&E rates have increased at a much faster rate than inflation due to fire safety improvements to help reduce the risk of future fires. As it stands, PG&E\u2019s customers are already paying some of the highest electricity rates in the state, averaging 20.06 cents per kilowatt hour, compared to the statewide average of 16.06 cents per kilowatt and the national average of 10.48 cents per kilowatt hour.   \n  \nWhile Kammen also acknowledges that upfront cost is one of the major challenges involved in transitioning campus away from fossil fuels, he proposes that \u201cin the long term, moving to renewables and storage will save us money.\u201d He believes UC Berkeley could make money from selling excess renewable energy generated on campus back to PG&E. An additional consideration is that the plant is so old that sometime in the next 5-10 years, a significant investment is going to be necessary to keep it running at its current capacity, according to the director of UC Berkeley\u2019s Office of Sustainability, Kira Stoll. As McGarrahan states, \u201cAnything we do is going to be expensive.\u201d She also emphasizes that the cost of transitioning away from the cogen will be upfront rather than sustained, and requires a mix of debt, donations, and grants as possible means to finance campus\u2019s future energy landscape.   \n  \n## Energy resiliency  \n  \nAn additional\u2014and increasingly important\u2014consideration for any future energy scenario on campus is resiliency. A resilient energy system would keep campus powered in emergencies that make external electricity unavailable. The cogen plant is resilient but buying the majority of our electricity from PG&E would not be. Stoll states, \u201cWe need to create that same kind of resiliency we have right now with our own plant with whatever system we move to.\u201d   \n  \nConsiderations of energy resilience have become more pressing since the PG&E shutdowns of 2019. As McGarrahan explains, \u201cWe were aware, but not with the hyper-awareness we gained last fall, so this has affected our planning.\u201d She shares that one potential direction under consideration is maintaining the cogen plant to keep serving the southside of campus, with the capability to provide electricity to the whole campus as backup. The rest of campus\u2019s heating needs would be served by the introduction of smaller, more localized nodal thermal plants distributed around the campus. The advantage of localized generation of energy is increased efficiency while phasing the campus towards serving the heavier loads if needed. While using the cogen plant as a potential backup source of electricity for the whole campus was not originally considered in this scenario, it is now being included in order to provide a reliable source of backup power in the case of recurring problems with power delivery from PG&E.   \n  \nKammen believes that an energy-resilient campus and a sustainable campus are not incompatible. He suggests that a potential solution would be to use our available physical resources around campus, including the current site of the cogen plant, to house different energy storage technology such as lithium ion batteries, flow batteries, and fly wheels that would provide \u201cseveral days\u2019 capacity of storage on site.\u201d LBL staff scientist Piette also echoes the call for clean backup in the form of \u201cphotovoltaics and batteries for as much as we can,\u201d in combination with a cultural shift to using less energy on campus. For example, people on campus could limit the use of energy-intensive equipment to the middle of the day when more renewable energy sources like wind and solar are available and electricity from the grid is at its cleanest and cheapest. Additionally, people could be more prepared to enter and emerge from emergency modes. \u201cWe could run parts of the buildings and keep things up, but \u2026 not turn the entire campus off,\u201d Piette suggests.   \n  \n## Next steps  \n  \nCampus leadership and other stakeholders on campus\u2014including financial experts, engineers, and faculty across a range of departments\u2014are currently in the lengthy process of evaluating the proposed energy scenarios from several different perspectives, including capital costs, potential environmental impacts, the type of land-use required, cost to update current infrastructure, and how to meet the UC policy around carbon neutrality.   \n  \nStoll explains that an additional major challenge of trying to plan for a long-term future without the cogen plant is that technology in this area, especially energy storage, are constantly evolving and changing. \u201cThe other thing we\u2019re looking at is how can we build something that can accommodate new, lower cost technology going forward, as they become available,\u201d Stoll conveys. Plans must be flexible enough to incorporate new technologies as they arise. As McGarahan says, \u201cWe try to be aware all the time of not putting too rigid a box around what we\u2019re doing \u2026 fuel cells, hydrogen\u2014you name it, we\u2019re interested.\u201d   \n  \nUltimately, the future of UC Berkeley\u2019s cogen plant depends upon a collision of factors: cost, social and political dynamics, and the ever-evolving science behind energy resiliency, technology, and sustainability. The 2025 carbon neutrality goal, however, adds additional pressure for a decision about the future of the cogen plant to be made quickly. As Kammen states, \u201cWe either make it or not based on the decision now.\u201d   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/07\\_Stakeholders\\_Web.png) *Design: Emily Gonthier*",

    "markdown":"\u201cWilderness is not a luxury but a necessity of the human spirit, and as vital to our lives as water and good bread.\u201d -Edward Abbey.   \n  \nFor better or for worse, the last six months in the United States have made us reconsider a lot of things. The past few months have brought a public health crisis unlike any in over a century and revealed the extreme disparities and deeply ingrained prejudices that continue to plague our culture. The number 2020 will forever be associated with seemingly endless bad news and political unrest. While public indoor spaces have almost universally been shuttered due to the associated health risks, people have begun to turn to the outdoors like never before. [Sales of outdoor equipment have skyrocketed](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/09\/08\/909836817\/amid-a-deep-recession-outdoor-equipment-is-flying-off-the-shelves) and people who previously never ventured far from home are going outside for exercise, exploration, and to find solace in nature. However, this increase in outdoor endeavors places new, unanticipated burdens on our public lands.   \n  \nThis then evokes the question, what really *is* public land? According to one [definition](https:\/\/www.rei.com\/blog\/hike\/your-guide-to-understanding-public-lands), public lands are \u201careas of land that are open to the public and managed by the government.\u201d It can be thought of as land that is communally owned by all citizens of a country or region. This can include federally-managed land, state parks, and even your local city and regional parks. Of the 2.27 billion acres of total land in the United States, about 8.7 percent is state and locally owned and 28 percent is managed by the federal government by four different primary agencies: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), US Forest Service (USFS), US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service (NPS). In California specifically, 52.1 percent of the total land area is public, and of that public land over 90 percent is federally-owned.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/bsr2.png) *Distribution of federal public land in California, divided amongst the Forest Service, Department of Defense, National Park Service, Fish & Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. Percentage of land by agency is shown, demonstrating that federal land makes up a vast portion of California's land area.*   \n  \nJust as important to understanding what public lands *are* is understanding [*where they came from*](https:\/\/publicland.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/150359\\_Public\\_Lands\\_Document\\_web.pdf). In the 1700s, the federal government claimed millions of acres of land from Native Americans. Additionally, through conquest and treaty settlements, lands were obtained from several other countries, while many land stakes were relinquished by the colonies to the federal government. Although two thirds of these \u201coriginal\u201d public lands were eventually transferred out of the public domain to the states, various corporations, and individual settlement, other large portions of it were set aside for national forests, monuments, wildlife reserves, and federal reservations for Native American Tribes. The settlers of the American West during this era undoubtedly had different priorities than we do today, but the legacy of their actions continues to affect the ways that land is owned and managed in our country. The exploitation of indigenous peoples is a fraught legacy that our country has grappled with for generations, and is still battling today.   \n  \nDespite the harmful legacy of colonization of the American West and all that it left in its wake, there were those who fought to keep parts of the land as they were for no other reason than the preservation of wildness. The emergence of environmentalism as an idea or set of values may not have fully formed, but the pioneers of the wilderness emerged: big thinkers like Edward Abbey, David Brower, and John Muir, among many others, started important conversations about what responsible land use might look like. While native voices were largely left out of these discussions, the idea that parts of the \u201cwild\u201d American West should be kept for future generations remained. In turn, these early environmentalists laid the framework for the future of public land management, and the patchwork of future organizations like BLM and NPS. The idea began to emerge that preserving wildness is not just about preserving nature or the land itself; it is as much about preserving the human interaction with it. Human beings need wilderness, both as a humbling reminder of our own insignificance, and also as a means to see the world in its rawest form\u2014a world far more mysterious and elaborate than our own.   \n  \nPerhaps these places that let us roam free have never been more needed than today as we collectively face countless crises. Our regional parks, state parks and forests, coastlines, and national parks have seen a huge uptick in visitation, and it is heartening to see so many new people with a desire to get out into nature. However, with that visitation also inevitably comes more abuse of these spaces and greater costs to the park systems. Many California local parks and national parks alike have seen [increases in vandalism](https:\/\/time.com\/5869788\/national-parks-covid-19\/), trespassing, and general disrespect for these public places, directly resulting from the increase in visitation since the start of the pandemic.   \n  \nEven without the increased stresses the park systems are currently experiencing, national and state parks have been struggling with finances and resources for many years. The approximately [$12 billion backlog](https:\/\/therevelator.org\/budget-crunch-national-parks\/) in repair funding to the NPS has led to deteriorating facilities as well as inadequate staff and rangers to serve the increasing numbers of park visitors. California state parks have been facing similar budget woes over the past decade, as a mismatch between increased visitation and decreased funding has left the parks scrambling for resources.   \n  \nVery recently, however, some big changes have been brewing, most notably the passing of [The Great American Outdoors Act](https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/subjects\/legal\/great-american-outdoors-act.htm) by the federal government. The bill guarantees about a billion dollars per year to the Land & Water Conservation Fund (using royalties from offshore oil and natural gas industries), and establishes a National Parks Restoration Fund, which will provide significant funding for much-needed maintenance and repairs at national parks. More specifically, it will use revenue from energy development to provide up to $1.9 billion a year for five years for maintenance of infrastructure and other critical facilities across all federal public lands. The passing of this act will create jobs and represents real investment not only in the park system, but also in the communities that rely on them and the people who cherish them.   \n  \nTo showcase some benefits of this act, let\u2019s take a look at how California may be impacted specifically. The 2020 wildfire season has been more devastating than any in state history, with an immense associated economic cost. One of the tools used to prevent wildfires and promote healthy forest ecosystems is prescribed burning, or controlled wildlands fires which are intentionally set to clear excess undergrowth. However, prescribed burns are not currently utilized as frequently or as extensively as would be needed to notably decrease the risk of extreme wildfires. There are several factors preventing a more widespread practice, but the most notable is due to significant underfunding of the USFS. Due to scarce funding and resources, the USFS has had to use the vast majority of its fire budget on active wildfires, which has diverted funding away from prevention. Additional resources provided for the USFS from this legislation can help ensure that it has the funding and staff necessary to better prepare for and prevent megafires as the warming climate continues to present additional challenges.   \n  \nThe state of California is full of natural beauty, which is apparent in its many [national parks, monuments, and seashores](https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/state\/ca\/index.htm). Very close to home, places like Point Reyes National Seashore, Alcatraz Island, Muir Woods, and Golden Gate National Recreation Area are all managed by the NPS and as a result will receive more funding for improvements as a result of this act. California is also home to several very well-known national parks throughout the Sierra Nevada, Southern Cascades, and North Coast. These include iconic places like Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon, Lassen, and Redwood National Parks. These timeless places are not only beloved to many Californians and visitors around the world, but are also home to many threatened species for whom protection of the land is critical. In Yosemite specifically, the backlogged projects that will now have funding include meadow rehabilitation and the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant. In Point Reyes, the plans now include repairing the deteriorating Bolinas Ridge trail and rehabilitation of the Historic Point Reyes Radio Receiving Station. The list of backlogged infrastructure projects and budget deficits for each Western NPS location can be found [here](https:\/\/npgallery.nps.gov\/GetAsset\/ad18291c-0ea1-4adc-847d-904ec10efc08\/original). In addition to improved infrastructure, increasing the number of park staff helps to improve the education of visitors, and in turn prevent damage to these resources through increased practice of [Leave No Trace](https:\/\/lnt.org\/) principles.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/bsr3.png) *The newly enacted Great American Outdoors Act will provide funding for improvement projects across a variety of landscapes in California, including trail improvements, facilities updates, and forest management.*   \n  \nApart from the popular national parks, California is also home to many lesser-known public lands like national forests, state forests, and wildernesses that make up much of its land areas. Places like Tahoe National Forest, the Trinity Alps Wilderness, and other Northern Sierra wildernesses like Emigrant, Desolation, and Mokelumne are examples. While they may not draw as much fame or attention as their NPS neighbors, these public lands make up a vast amount of land area and in turn require significant resources and maintenance. The establishment of the Public Lands Legacy Restoration Fund, one part of the new Outdoors Act, helps ensure that these lands receive the attention they need.   \n  \nIn addition to the vast sweeping landscapes further afield, it\u2019s important that we not forget that our city parks, regional parks, and playgrounds are also public lands. Many of these local spaces have benefitted directly from projects under the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Here in the city of Berkeley specifically, [projects that have been funded by LWCF](http:\/\/projects.invw.org\/data\/lwcf\/grants-ca.html) include the development of Aquatic Park and North Waterfront Park, as well as the Berkeley Rose Garden and Codornices Park. Local projects like these also improve equity in access to the outdoors by ensuring that all people have access to outdoor green spaces, regardless of the community they grew up in. By focusing not only on dramatic landscapes in remote places, but also on things like bike paths and open spaces in urban areas, we ensure that access to green space is not a privilege, but a right of all Americans.   \n  \nWhile this new law represents a major win for our country and our state, it is still far from addressing all of the many environmental stresses we face today. The climate crisis we currently face is one that will take collective effort to address, and providing adequate funding for public lands is only one facet of the highly convoluted issue of the preservation of these shared wild spaces. We know that preserving these sacred places is vital to our physical and mental wellbeing. Further, improving access to public lands for all ensures that future generations will get to experience these beautiful places and want to protect them for the generations after them, as well. By creating stewards for public lands, we also create climate advocates and nature-lovers, which might be what the world needs in this time of climate and environmental crisis. So I hope that the next time you head to your favorite regional park, you remember that that land had to be protected by someone\u2014a person who saw its potential to make the world a better place. The continued protection of these lands, and wild places everywhere, relies on all of us to recognize their significance and speak up for their future.   \n  \n-------   \n  \n*Laura Treers is a graduate student in mechanical engineering*   \n  \n*Designs by Julia Torvi*",

    "markdown":"You may have come across the term \u201cinformational interview\u201d at some point during grad school. In fact, you may have already conducted informational interviews without realizing it! Talking to a professor about the academic hiring process or asking a former lab member what their life in industry is like are just a few types of informational interviews that can arise naturally for a grad student in STEM. Conducting informational interviews throughout grad school is fantastic for illuminating different sorts of post-PhD career opportunities, as well as for establishing a professional network for the future.   \n  \nSo, what is informational interviewing? Simply put, it\u2019s the process of having a conversation with someone about their career, usually to seek career advice or to learn more about a particular field. In academia, this commonly happens during typical mentor-mentee relationships\u2014postdoc\/grad student, advisor\/grad student, etc. For example, having a conversation with a junior faculty member about their experience applying to tenure-track positions provides first-hand perspective on the academic job market.   \n  \nHowever, for grad students, informational interviewing is arguably even more useful when talking with people outside of academia. While grad school tends to give students an adequate understanding of the academic job market, many departments do a comparatively poorer job of educating their trainees on non-academic careers, despite that fact that [the majority of STEM PhDs](https:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/careers\/2019\/03\/first-us-private-sector-employs-nearly-many-phds-schools-do) ultimately never end up in tenure-track faculty positions.   \n  \nInformational interviewing is a good way to fill this knowledge gap and learn more about the myriad careers available to someone with a graduate degree. For example, a cursory search for jobs that employ STEM PhDs includes professions like consultant, science writer, patent agent, educator, program manager, and university administrator\u2014these positions all value a PhD but may not be obvious options to a grad student immersed in dissertation research. Having a one-on-one conversation with someone currently working in one of these fields can provide invaluable guidance for post-PhD possibilities, whether it\u2019s learning about the lifestyle of a management consultant or asking about the career progression of a university dean.   \n  \n\u201cCompared to just reading articles, blogs, or websites,\u201d says Rosanne Lurie, the director of Graduate and PostDoc Career Development at [QB3-Berkeley](https:\/\/qb3.berkeley.edu\/), \u201cinformational interviews generally give you substantive, reliable \u2018inside-scoop\u2019 career information, and are significantly less time consuming than being an intern. They hit a sweet spot of efficiency in your career planning efforts.\u201d   \n  \nBeyond gathering information, informational interviewing is a fantastic and organic way to grow your own professional network. This holds doubly true for grad students considering a career beyond academia, in industries where academic contacts might not be as helpful. By casting nets in fields that you\u2019ve considered entering in the future, you can begin establishing professional contacts that may prove useful when searching for a job. [After all, most jobs are obtained primarily through networking](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/new-survey-reveals-85-all-jobs-filled-via-networking-lou-adler\/).   \n  \nNevertheless, networking can feel like a daunting, even random, affair\u2014after all, who knows if that spontaneous coffee break chat at a conference could lead to a future career? \u201cInformational interviewing is a more formal approach to connecting with other people that doesn\u2019t require extroversion,\u201d Lurie points out. Instead, it just necessitates \u201ca bit of thoughtfulness and planning.\u201d   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/BSRBlog\\_InfoInterviews\\_Fig1.png) *Who could you interview? It\u2019s easiest to start with your personal contacts and to ask them to introduce you to people in their own personal networks. You can also cold-contact people via email or LinkedIn but that is less likely to yield a response.*   \n  \nSo, how do you go about conducting an informational interview? The first step is to identify someone you\u2019d like to talk to. For example, if you\u2019re curious about what a career in science communication is like, you might want to reach out to a science writer to ask them about their professional life. Or, if you\u2019re thinking of relocating from Berkeley to Seattle, you might consider chatting with a contact in Seattle to start growing a network there. Whatever the reason, it\u2019s crucial to identify your interviewee. It\u2019s generally easiest to start with personal contacts\u2014friends, labmates, cohort members, etc.\u2014or to ask them to introduce you to people outside of your immediate network. When all else fails, cold-contacting people through email or LinkedIn is another possibility, albeit one that is generally less successful than utilizing your existing network. Importantly, you will need to make it clear that 1) you\u2019re primarily interested in information gathering, and *not* asking for a job, and 2) you\u2019re hoping for a short chat that won\u2019t take up too much time\u2014thirty minutes or less is a good rule of thumb. Many people will happily agree to this sort of informal conversation.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/BSRBlog\\_InfoInterviews\\_Fig2.png) *What are the key elements of an informational interview? (1) Prepare specific question(s) you have that your interviewee can help answer. (2) Keep it short and sweet, around 30 minutes. (3) Do not ask your interviewee for a job.*   \n  \nRegarding the interview itself, preparation is key. Because the conversation might be short, it\u2019s crucial that you know ahead of time what you\u2019re hoping to get out of the interaction, be it career advice, field-specific knowledge, or something else. \u201cBe prepared not just to ask questions,\u201d Lurie advises, \u201cbut to talk about yourself in relation to the interests of the [interviewee] and even the organization where they work.\u201d   \n  \nAt the same time, it\u2019s good to avoid over-preparing, and to let the conversation flow organically. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know, and you may learn something unexpected that is valuable,\u201d Lurie says, \u201csuch as a type of career or organization you did not know existed.\u201d Towards the end, you may want to ask your interviewee if they have suggestions for other people who would be useful to talk to. This is a way to learn more about people in your field of interest, and to grow your own network naturally.   \n  \n![](https:\/\/berkeleysciencereview.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/BSRBlog\\_InfoInterviews\\_Fig3.png) *What do you talk about during an informational interview? Start the conversation by introducing yourself and what type of research you are doing during your PhD. Informational interviews work best when you then articulate a specific career-related question that you believe your interviewee can help answer. Allow the conversation to flow and be open to new topics or information that your interviewee brings up. Finally, always end the conversation by asking if your interviewee can suggest other people you should talk to. (Figure adapted from Networking and Informational Interviewing workshop materials developed by Rosanne Lurie, MS, Director, QB3-Berkeley Graduate and Postdoc Career Development and Alicia Roy, PhD, Hitchcock Postdoctoral Fellow, UC Berkeley Graduate Division, GradPro.)*   \n  \nAfter the interview, it\u2019s important to follow up. This means reviewing the interaction and processing what you\u2019ve learned, how it helps in your career exploration, and what points you might want to inquire about in the future. Additionally, it\u2019s polite to send an appreciative note to your interviewee thanking them for their time, and to follow through on any actions you may have discussed during your interview (e.g. connecting via LinkedIn, making an email introduction, etc.). On the longer timescale, it\u2019s good practice to stay in touch with your interviewees to keep them updated on your own situation and how the conversation has impacted you. \u201cRemember, this connection is mutual,\u201d says Lurie, \u201c[and] at some point in the future, you may find you are helpful to them, as they have been for you.\u201d   \n  \n-------   \n  \n*Jonathan Liu is a graduate student in phyiscs*   \n  \n*Designs by Meghan Turner*",
